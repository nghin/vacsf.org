&lt;h2 id=&quot;hebrews-21-18&quot;&gt;HEBREWS 2:1-18&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://vacsf.org/assets/images/Hebrews-teaser.jpg&quot; style=&quot;border: 0px none; margin: 7px 15px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 148px; padding: 0px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(159, 29, 33);&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Therefore we must &lt;u&gt;pay closer attention&lt;/u&gt; to what we have heard, so that we do not drift away. &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;For if the message spoken through angels proved to be so firm that every violation or disobedience received its just penalty, &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;u&gt;how will we escape if we neglect such a great salvation?&lt;/u&gt; It was first communicated through the Lord and was confirmed to us by those who heard him, &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;while God confirmed their witness with signs and wonders and various miracles and gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to his will. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;For he did not put &lt;u&gt;the world to come&lt;/u&gt;, about which we are speaking, under the control of angels. &lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;Instead someone testified somewhere: &lt;strong&gt;“What is man that you think of him or the son of man that you care for him? &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;You made him lower than the angels for a little while. You crowned him with glory and honor. &lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;You put all things under his control.”&lt;/strong&gt; For when he put &lt;strong&gt;all things under his control&lt;/strong&gt;, he left nothing outside of his control. At present we do not yet see &lt;strong&gt;all things under his control&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;but we see Jesus, who was made &lt;strong&gt;lower than the angels for a little while&lt;/strong&gt;, now crowned with glory and honor because he suffered death, so that by God’s grace he would experience death on behalf of everyone. &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;For it was fitting for him, for whom and through whom all things exist, in bringing many sons to glory, to make the pioneer of their salvation perfect through sufferings. &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;For indeed he who makes holy and those being made holy all have &lt;strong&gt;the same origin&lt;/strong&gt;, and so he is not ashamed to call them brothers and sisters, &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;saying, “I will proclaim your name to my brothers; in the midst of the assembly I will praise you.” &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;Again he says, “I will be confident in him,” and again, &lt;strong&gt;“Here I am, with the children God has given me.”&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;Therefore, since the children share in flesh and blood, &lt;strong&gt;he likewise shared in their humanity, so that through death he could destroy the one who holds the power of death&lt;/strong&gt; (that is, the devil), &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;and set free those who were held in slavery all their lives by their fear of death. &lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;For surely his concern is not for angels, but he is concerned for Abraham’s descendants. &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therefore he had to be made like his brothers and sisters in every respect&lt;/strong&gt;, so that he could become a merciful and faithful high priest in things relating to God, to make atonement for the sins of the people. &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;For since he himself suffered when he was tempted, he is able to help those who are tempted. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (Hebrews 2:1-18)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pay-closer-attention&quot;&gt;PAY CLOSER ATTENTION&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(159, 29, 33);&quot;&gt;
&lt;i&gt;“&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Therefore we must pay closer attention to what we have heard, so that we do not &lt;strong&gt;drift away&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;For if the &lt;strong&gt;message&lt;/strong&gt; spoken through angels proved to be so firm that every violation or disobedience received its just penalty, &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;how will we escape if we &lt;strong&gt;neglect such a great salvation&lt;/strong&gt;? It was first communicated through the Lord and was confirmed to us by those who heard him, &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;while God confirmed their witness with signs and wonders and various miracles and gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to his will. &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;For he did not put &lt;strong&gt;the world to come&lt;/strong&gt;, about which we are speaking, &lt;strong&gt;under the control of angels&lt;/strong&gt;.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (Hebrews 2:1-5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While angels, signs, wonders, and miracles are referenced in this passage, the primary focus lies on two central themes: salvation and the message itself. The signs, wonders, and miracles serve as a means to underscore the significance of the message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The core purpose of the message is to highlight the profound salvation we should be more attentive to. Although God employed angels as messengers, it’s essential to recognize that these angels do not have authority over &lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“the world to come,”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt; which is synonymous with our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we progress through the book of Hebrews, it becomes evident that the revelation of the message regarding salvation will take center stage. In this context, we will gain a deeper understanding of what the Hebrews might be &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“drifting away from”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; or how they might be &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“neglecting such a great salvation.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; One thing that can be assured is that they are not straying from the teachings of the Mosaic law or seeking salvation through strict adherence to the law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;all-things-under-his-control&quot;&gt;ALL THINGS UNDER HIS CONTROL&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(159, 29, 33);&quot;&gt;
&lt;i&gt;“&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;Instead someone testified somewhere: “What is man that you think of him or the son of man that you care for him? &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;You made him lower than the angels for a little while. You crowned him with glory and honor. &lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You put all things under his control.”&lt;/strong&gt;”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (Hebrews 2:6-8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is evident that he wields authority over all things, as he is the architect of the cosmos. As Colossians 1:16-17 affirms, &lt;i&gt;“&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;For all things in heaven and on earth were created in him – all things, whether visible or invisible, whether thrones or dominions, whether principalities or powers – all things were created through him and for him. &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;He himself is before all things and all things are held together in him.”&lt;/i&gt; (Colossians 1:16-17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, the paramount focus is not on his rule over creation, angels, or demons, but rather on his redemptive plan. His pronouncements on the salvation of sinners are absolute. How do you envision your path to salvation? In the book of Hebrews, you’ll have the opportunity to realign your comprehension of the gospel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;jesus-shares-in-our-humanity&quot;&gt;JESUS SHARES IN OUR HUMANITY&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(159, 29, 33);&quot;&gt;
&lt;i&gt;“&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;For indeed he who makes holy and those being made holy all have &lt;strong&gt;the same origin&lt;/strong&gt;, … &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;Therefore, since the children share in flesh and blood, &lt;strong&gt;he likewise shared in their humanity, … &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;Therefore he had to be made like his brothers and sisters in every respect&lt;/strong&gt;, so that he could become a merciful and faithful high priest in things relating to God, to make atonement for the sins of the people. &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;For since he himself suffered when he was tempted, he is able to help those who are tempted.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (Hebrews 2:11,14,17-18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the exception of a sinful nature, Jesus is essentially identical to us in every aspect, fully participating in our flesh and blood, sharing in our humanity. This means that he can experience every emotion that humans are capable of feeling, including our sorrow, pain, and yearning, encompassing all our negative emotions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I’ve observed that certain Christian belief systems tend to reject or downplay negative emotions. They may enthusiastically join in celebrating your joys with hallelujahs but may not stand by your side during your moments of distress or empathize with your pain. If you were to examine their language, you’d find it predominantly composed of positive words. If you’re grappling with an illness and their prayers don’t bring healing, don’t anticipate their presence to offer comfort during your period of hardship.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(159, 29, 33);&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;u&gt;After God spoke long ago in various portions and in various ways to our ancestors through the prophets, &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;in these last days he has spoken to us in a son&lt;/u&gt;, whom he appointed heir of all things, and through whom he created the world. &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Son is the radiance of his glory and the representation of his essence&lt;/u&gt;, and he sustains all things by his powerful word, and so when he had &lt;u&gt;accomplished cleansing for sins&lt;/u&gt;, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high. &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;Thus he became so far better than the angels as he has inherited a name superior to theirs. &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;For to which of the angels did God ever say, &lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;You are my son! Today I have fathered you?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And in another place he says: &lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;I will be his father and he will be my son?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;But when he again brings his firstborn into the world, he says: &lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Let all the angels of God worship him!&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;And he says of the angels: &lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;He makes his angels winds and his ministers a flame of fire&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;but of the Son he says: &lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Your throne, O God, is forever and ever, and a righteous scepter is the scepter of your kingdom. &lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;You have loved righteousness and hated lawlessness. So God, your God, has anointed you over your companions with the oil of rejoicing.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;And, &lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;You founded the earth in the beginning, Lord, and the heavens are the works of your hands. &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;They will perish, but you continue. And they will all grow old like a garment, &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;and like a robe you will fold them up and like a garment they will be changed, but you are the same and your years will never run out.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;But to which of the angels has he ever said: &lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;Are they not all ministering spirits, sent out to serve those who will inherit salvation? &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (Hebrews 1:1-14)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The central and pivotal idea in this chapter, and arguably throughout the entire book, revolves around the vital role of Jesus Christ. The chapter begins by highlighting that in the past, God communicated with our ancestors through various means and prophets, but in these modern times, He has chosen to convey His message through His Son.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The subsequent portion of the chapter describes Jesus in such majestic terms that surpass any previous descriptions of prophets. Therefore, the significance lies in the fact that while God communicated with prophets in the past, His communication through His Son, Jesus, signifies that He has something of even greater importance to convey. This implies that while Jesus’ message may not contradict what was previously spoken through the prophets, it carries a unique and heightened significance compared to what was communicated before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the forthcoming chapters, we will discover what God intends to communicate to us through His Son.&lt;/p&gt;

## A TESTAMENT TO THE LIGHT

&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(159, 29, 33);&quot;&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&quot;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A man came, sent from God, whose name was John.  &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;He came as a &lt;strong&gt;witness to testify about the light&lt;/strong&gt;, so that everyone might believe through him.  &lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;He himself was not the light, but he came to testify about the light.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (John 1:6-8)

&lt;p&gt;A verse-by-verse study of the book of Hebrews&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://vacsf.org/bible-studies-viet/Hebrews/&quot;&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Bấm vào đây để đọc tiếng Việt&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;hebrews-11-14&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://vacsf.org/hebrews/Hebrews-01-v01-14/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Hebrews 1:1-14&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hebrews 1 emphasizes the superiority of Jesus Christ over the angels. It affirms that God has spoken to humanity through His Son, who is the heir of all things and the Creator of the universe. Jesus is depicted as the radiance of God’s glory and the exact representation of His nature. In this way, Hebrews 1 introduces the central theme of the book, which is the supremacy of Jesus and the New Covenant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;hebrews-21-18&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://vacsf.org/hebrews/Hebrews-02-v01-18/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Hebrews 2:1-18&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book of Hebrews, chapter 2, emphasizes the importance of paying close attention to the message of salvation brought by Jesus. It highlights Jesus’ superiority to angels and how, as the perfect Son of God, He became a human to identify with humanity and lead them to salvation. The chapter warns against neglecting this great salvation and encourages believers to remain faithful and not drift away from their faith. It also stresses Jesus’ role as the pioneer of salvation and the high priest who intercedes for believers. Ultimately, Hebrews 2 underscores the significance of holding firm to the message of salvation and not taking it lightly.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(159, 29, 33);&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Vậy nên, chúng ta phải càng giữ vững lấy điều mình đã nghe e kẻo bị trôi lạc chăng. &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Vì nên lời thiên sứ rao truyền đã vững chắc và sự trái phép nghịch mạng đã được báo ứng xứng đáng rồi, &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;mà nếu ta còn trễ nải sự cứu rỗi lớn dường ấy, thì làm sao tránh cho khỏi được? là sự cứu rỗi Chúa truyền ra trước hết, rồi có những kẻ nghe chứng nghiệm nó cho chúng ta, &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;Ðức Chúa Trời cũng dùng những dấu kỳ sự lạ và đủ thứ phép mầu, lại dùng sự ban cho của Ðức Thánh Linh mà Ngài đã theo ý muốn mình phát ra, để làm chứng với các kẻ đó. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;Vả, thế gian hầu đến mà chúng ta nói đó, Ðức Chúa Trời chẳng từng khiến nó phục dưới quyền các thiên sứ. &lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;Nhưng có kẻ đã làm chứng rằng: &lt;strong&gt;Loài người là gì mà Chúa nhớ đến? Con người là ai, mà Chúa săn sóc đến? &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;Chúa đã đặt Người ở dưới thiên sứ một chút; Cho Người đội mão triều vinh hiển tôn trọng; &lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;Và đặt mọi vật dưới chơn người.&lt;/strong&gt; Ðức Chúa Trời đã khiến &lt;strong&gt;mọi vật phục Ðức Chúa Jêsus&lt;/strong&gt; như vậy; thì chẳng để cho một vật nào chẳng phục Ngài; song hiện nay chúng ta chưa thấy &lt;strong&gt;mọi vật phục Ngài&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;Nhưng Ðức Chúa Jêsus nầy, mà đã &lt;strong&gt;ở dưới các thiên sứ một chút&lt;/strong&gt;, chúng ta thấy Ngài, vì sự chết Ngài đã chịu được đội mão triều vinh hiển tôn trọng. Ấy vậy, bởi ân điển của Ðức Chúa Trời, Ðức Chúa Jêsus đã vì mọi người nếm sự chết. &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;Thật, Ðấng mà muôn vật hướng về Ngài và bởi Ngài, vì muốn đem nhiều con đến sự vinh hiển, thì đã khiến Ðấng làm cội rễ sự cứu rỗi của những con ấy, nhờ sự đau đớn mà nên trọn lành, là phải lắm. &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;Vì Ðấng làm nên thánh và kẻ được nên thánh, đều bởi một Cha mà ra. Cho nên Ngài không thẹn mà gọi những kẻ đó là anh em, &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;khi Ngài có phán: &lt;strong&gt;Tôi sẽ truyền danh Chúa cho anh em tôi; Và ngợi khen Chúa ở giữa hội.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;Ngài lại phán: Ta sẽ phó thác ta cho Chúa. Lại phán: &lt;strong&gt;Ta đây, ta với các con cái mà Ðức Chúa Trời đã ban cho ta.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;Vậy thì, vì con cái có phần về huyết và thịt, nên chính Ðức Chúa Jêsus cũng có phần vào đó, hầu cho Ngài bởi sự chết mình mà phá diệt kẻ cầm quyền sự chết, là ma quỉ, &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;lại cho giải thoát mọi người vì sợ sự chết, bị cầm trong vòng tôi mọi trọn đời. &lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;Vì quả thật không phải Ngài đến vùa giúp các thiên sứ, bèn là vùa giúp dòng dõi của Áp-ra-ham. &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;Nhơn đó, Ngài phải chịu làm giống như anh em mình trong mọi sự, hầu cho đối với Ðức Chúa Trời, trở nên thầy tế lễ thượng phẩm, hay thương xót và trung tín, đặng đền tội cho chúng dân. &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;Vả, vì chính mình Ngài chịu khổ trong khi bị cám dỗ, nên có thể cứu những kẻ bị cám dỗ vậy. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (Hebrews 2:1-18)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;giỮ-vỮng-ĐiỀu-ĐÃ-nghe&quot;&gt;GIỮ VỮNG ĐIỀU ĐÃ NGHE&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(159, 29, 33);&quot;&gt;
&lt;i&gt;“&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Vậy nên, chúng ta phải càng giữ vững lấy điều mình đã nghe e kẻo bị &lt;strong&gt;trôi lạc&lt;/strong&gt; chăng. &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Vì nên lời thiên sứ rao truyền đã vững chắc và sự trái phép nghịch mạng đã được báo ứng xứng đáng rồi, &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;mà nếu ta còn &lt;strong&gt;trễ nải sự cứu rỗi lớn dường ấy&lt;/strong&gt;, thì làm sao tránh cho khỏi được? là sự cứu rỗi Chúa truyền ra trước hết, rồi có những kẻ nghe chứng nghiệm nó cho chúng ta, &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;Ðức Chúa Trời cũng dùng những dấu kỳ sự lạ và đủ thứ phép mầu, lại dùng sự ban cho của Ðức Thánh Linh mà Ngài đã theo ý muốn mình phát ra, để làm chứng với các kẻ đó. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;Vả, &lt;strong&gt;thế gian hầu đến&lt;/strong&gt; mà chúng ta nói đó, Ðức Chúa Trời chẳng từng khiến nó &lt;strong&gt;phục dưới quyền các thiên sứ&lt;/strong&gt;.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (Hebrews 2:1-5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trong khi thiên sứ và dấu kỳ phép lạ được đề cập trong đoạn kinh thánh này, trọng tâm chính nằm ở hai chủ đề: sự cứu rỗi và sứ điệp của Chúa qua các sứ giả của Ngài. Các dấu kỳ phép lạ được sử dụng để làm nổi bật tầm quan trọng của sứ điệp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mục tiêu trọng yếu của sứ điệp là nhấn mạnh sự cứu rỗi mà chúng ta nên quan tâm hơn. Mặc dù Chúa đã sử dụng các sứ giả để rao truyền sứ điệp, điều quan trọng là chúng ta phải nhận thức rằng các sứ giả này không có quyền lực gì đối với &lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“thế gian hầu đến,”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt; là sự cứu rỗi của chúng ta.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Khi chúng ta đào sâu hơn vào Sách Hê-bơ-rơ, chúng ta sẽ thấy rõ rằng những tiết lộ của sứ điệp về sự cứu rỗi sẽ chiếm vị trí trung tâm. Trong ngữ cảnh này, chúng ta sẽ hiểu rõ hơn về điều gì người Do Thái có thể đang &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“trôi lạc,”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; hoặc thể nào họ &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“trễ nải sự cứu rỗi lớn dường ấy.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Một điều có thể đảm bảo là họ không rời bỏ giảng dạy của luật Môi-se và không tìm kiếm sự cứu rỗi thông qua việc tuân theo luật pháp một cách nghiêm ngặt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mỌi-vẬt-phỤc-ngÀi&quot;&gt;MỌI VẬT PHỤC NGÀI&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(159, 29, 33);&quot;&gt;
&lt;i&gt;“&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;Nhưng có kẻ đã làm chứng rằng: &lt;strong&gt;Loài người là gì mà Chúa nhớ đến? Con người là ai, mà Chúa săn sóc đến? &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;Chúa đã đặt Người ở dưới thiên sứ một chút; Cho Người đội mão triều vinh hiển tôn trọng; &lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;Và đặt mọi vật dưới chơn người.&lt;/strong&gt; Ðức Chúa Trời đã khiến &lt;strong&gt;mọi vật phục Ðức Chúa Jêsus&lt;/strong&gt; như vậy; thì chẳng để cho một vật nào chẳng phục Ngài; song hiện nay chúng ta chưa thấy &lt;strong&gt;mọi vật phục Ngài&lt;/strong&gt;.”&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (Hebrews 2:6-8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rõ ràng, Ngài có quyền lực trên tất cả mọi thứ, vì Ngài là tạo hóa của vũ trụ. Như Colossians 1:16-17 đã xác nhận: &lt;i&gt;“&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;Vì muôn vật đã được dựng nên trong Ngài, bất luận trên trời, dưới đất, vật thấy được, vật không thấy được, hoặc ngôi vua, hoặc quyền cai trị, hoặc chấp chánh, hoặc cầm quyền, đều là bởi Ngài và vì Ngài mà được dựng nên cả. &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;Ngài có trước muôn vật, và muôn vật đứng vững trong Ngài.”&lt;/i&gt; (Colossians 1:16-17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tuy nhiên, trọng tâm hàng đầu không phải là quyền thống trị của Ngài đối với sự sáng tạo, thiên thần hay ác quỷ, mà là chương trình cứu rỗi của Ngài. Các tuyên bố của Ngài về sự cứu rỗi tội nhân là tuyệt đối. Bạn hình dung thế nào về con đường cứu rỗi của Chúa? Trong Sách Hê-bơ-rơ, bạn sẽ có cơ hội điều chỉnh lại hiểu biết về phúc âm cứu rỗi của mình.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;phẦn-vỀ-huyẾt-vÀ-thỊt-cỦa-chÚa&quot;&gt;PHẦN VỀ HUYẾT VÀ THỊT CỦA CHÚA&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(159, 29, 33);&quot;&gt;
&lt;i&gt;“&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;Vì Ðấng làm nên thánh và kẻ được nên thánh, đều bởi một Cha mà ra. Cho nên Ngài không thẹn mà gọi những kẻ đó là anh em, … &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;Vậy thì, vì con cái có &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;phần về huyết và thịt&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, nên chính Ðức Chúa Jêsus cũng có phần vào đó, hầu cho Ngài bởi sự chết mình mà phá diệt kẻ cầm quyền sự chết, là ma quỉ, … &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;Nhơn đó, Ngài phải chịu làm giống như anh em mình trong mọi sự, hầu cho đối với Ðức Chúa Trời, trở nên thầy tế lễ thượng phẩm, hay thương xót và trung tín, đặng đền tội cho chúng dân. &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;Vả, vì chính mình Ngài chịu khổ trong khi bị cám dỗ, nên có thể cứu những kẻ bị cám dỗ vậy.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (Hebrews 2:11,14,17-18)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ngoại trừ bản chất vô tội, Đấng Christ hoàn toàn giống chúng ta ở mọi khía cạnh, hoàn toàn tham gia vào &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“phần về huyết và thịt”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; của chúng ta, chia sẻ với thân phận con người của chúng ta. Điều này có nghĩa rằng Ngài có thể trải nghiệm mọi cảm xúc mà con người có thể cảm nhận, bao gồm nỗi buồn, đau đớn và khao khát, bao gồm tất cả những cảm xúc tiêu cực của chúng ta.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tuy nhiên, tôi đã quan sát thấy rằng một số hệ thống tín lý trong tin lành có xu hướng từ chối hoặc không nhìn nhận những cảm xúc tiêu cực. Họ có thể tham gia mừng niềm vui của bạn bằng lời khen ngợi hallelujah nhưng sẽ không ở bên cạnh bạn trong những giai đoạn đau khổ hoặc cảm thông với nỗi đau của bạn. Nếu bạn xem xét ngôn ngữ của họ, bạn sẽ thấy chúng chủ yếu bao gồm những từ tích cực. Nếu bạn đang đối mặt với một căn bệnh và lời cầu nguyện của họ không mang lại sự chữa lành, đừng mong đợi họ sẽ ở bên bạn để đem lại sự an ủi trong thời gian khó khăn của bạn.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(159, 29, 33);&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Ðời xưa, Ðức Chúa Trời đã dùng các đấng tiên tri phán dạy tổ phụ chúng ta nhiều lần nhiều cách, &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;rồi đến những ngày sau rốt nầy, Ngài phán dạy chúng ta bởi Con Ngài, là Con mà Ngài đã lập lên kế tự muôn vật, lại bởi Con mà Ngài đã dựng nên thế gian; &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Con là sự chói sáng của sự vinh hiển Ðức Chúa Trời và hình bóng của bổn thể Ngài, lấy lời có quyền phép Ngài nâng đỡ muôn vật; sau khi Con làm xong sự sạch tội, bèn ngồi bên hữu Ðấng tôn nghiêm ở trong nơi rất cao, &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;vậy được hưởng danh cao hơn danh thiên sứ bao nhiêu, thì trở nên cao trọng hơn thiên sứ bấy nhiêu. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;Vả, Ðức Chúa Trời há có bao giờ phán cùng thiên sứ rằng: &lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Ngươi là Con ta, Ngày nay ta đã sanh ngươi?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Lại há có khi nào phán: &lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Ta sẽ làm Cha người, Người sẽ làm Con ta?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;Còn khi Ngài đưa Con đầu lòng mình vào thế gian, thì phán rằng: &lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Mọi thiên sứ của Ðức Chúa Trời phải thờ lạy Con.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;Nói về thiên sứ thì Ngài phán rằng: &lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Ðức Chúa Trời làm cho thiên sứ Ngài như gió, Và tôi tớ Ngài như ngọn lửa&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;Nhưng nói về Con thì lại phán rằng: &lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Hỡi Ðức Chúa Trời, ngôi Chúa còn mãi đời nọ qua đời kia, Quyền bính của nước Chúa là quyền bính ngay thẳng. &lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;Chúa ưa điều công bình, ghét điều gian ác; Cho nên, hỡi Chúa, Ðức Chúa Trời của Chúa lấy dầu vui mừng xức cho, Khiến Chúa trổi hơn kẻ đồng bạn mình.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;Lại có phán: &lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Hỡi Chúa, ban đầu trước hết Chúa đã dựng nền đất, Và các từng trời cũng là công việc của tay Chúa. &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;Trời đất sẽ hư đi, nhưng Chúa hằng có; Trời đất sẽ cũ đi như cái áo; &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;Ngài sẽ cuốn nó lại như cái áo choàng, Rồi trời đất sẽ biến đổi, Nhưng Chúa vẫn y nguyên, Các năm của Chúa không hề cùng.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;Ðức Chúa Trời há có bao giờ phán cùng thiên sứ nào rằng: &lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Hãy ngồi bên hữu ta, Cho đến chừng nào ta để kẻ thù nghịch làm bệ dưới chơn ngươi?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;Các thiên sứ há chẳng phải đều là thần hầu việc Ðức Chúa Trời, đã được sai xuống để giúp việc những người sẽ hưởng cơ nghiệp cứu rỗi hay sao?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (Hebrews 1:1-14)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trọng tâm của chương này, và hầu như của cả sách Hê-bơ-rơ, đều xoay vần xung quanh vai trò trọng yếu của Chúa Giê-su. Chương này khởi đầu bằng cách nhấn mạnh rằng mặc dầu trong quá khứ, Đức Chúa Trời đã giao thông với chúng ta qua các tiên tri, nhưng ngày nay, Ngài đã chọn để rao truyền sứ điệp qua Con Một của Ngài là Chúa Giê-su.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phần còn lại của chương một diễn tả Chúa Giê-su với những ngôn từ vĩ đại mà trước kia chẳng hề được dùng cho các tiên tri. Vì thế, điều quan trọng ở đây là mặc dầu trước kia Đức Chúa Trời đã truyền thông với chúng ta qua các tiên tri, sự truyền thông của Ngài với chúng ta ngày hôm nay qua Chúa Giê-su cho thấy Ngài có những điều còn quan trọng hơn nữa để truyền đạt cho chúng ta. Điều này ám chỉ rằng mặc dầu sứ điệp qua Chúa Giê-su có thể không mâu thuẫn với những điều Ngài đã phán qua các tiên tri, nhưng mang một tầm vóc quan trọng hơn những điều đã phán trước kia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trong những chương kế tiếp, chúng ta sẽ khám phá điều gì Đức Chúa Trời muốn truyền đạt cho chúng ta qua Con Một của Ngài.&lt;/p&gt;

## LÀM CHỨNG VỀ SỰ SÁNG

&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(159, 29, 33);&quot;&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&quot;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; Có một người Ðức Chúa Trời sai đến, tên là Giăng.  &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; Người đến để &lt;strong&gt;làm chứng về sự sáng&lt;/strong&gt;, hầu cho bởi người ai nấy đều tin.  &lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; Chính người chẳng phải là sự sáng, song người phải làm chứng về sự sáng.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (John 1:6-8)

&lt;/nav&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Học sách Hê-bơ-rơ theo từng câu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;hê-bơ-rơ-11-14&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://vacsf.org/hebrews-viet/Hebrews-01-v01-14-Viet/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Hê-bơ-rơ 1:1-14&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hê-bơ-rơ 1 nhấn mạnh sự siêu việt của Đấng Christ so với các thiên sứ. Quả quyết rằng Đức Chúa Trời đã phán với nhân loại qua Con Một của Ngài, là Đấng Ngài đã chọn để làm chủ tể muôn loài. Chúa Giê-su được diễn tả như sự vinh hiển và hình ảnh trung thực của Đức Chúa Trời. Và như thế, Hê-bơ-rơ chương 1 giới thiệu trọng tâm của sách, đó là sự siêu việt của Chúa Giê-su và Giao Ước Mới.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;hebrews-21-18&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://vacsf.org/hebrews-viet/Hebrews-02-v01-18-Viet/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Hebrews 2:1-18&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sách Hê-bơ-rơ, chương 2, nhấn mạnh tầm quan trọng của việc chú ý đến thông điệp cứu rỗi được đưa ra bởi Chúa Giê-su. Nó tôn vinh sự vượt trội của Chúa Giê-su so với các thiên sứ và sự Chúa Giê-su, là Con Chúa hoàn hảo, đã trở thành con người để đồng cảm với nhân loại và dẫn họ đến sự cứu rỗi. Chương này cảnh báo về việc bỏ qua cơ hội cứu rỗi tuyệt vời này và khuyến khích những người tin Chúa duy trì và không lìa xa đức tin mà họ đã nhận lãnh. Nó cũng nhấn mạnh vai trò của Chúa Giê-su như Đấng tiên phong trong sự cứu rỗi và là Đấng cầu thay cho những kẻ tin Ngài. Cuối cùng, Hê-bơ-rơ 2 làm nổi bật tầm quan trọng của việc vững tin vào thông điệp cứu rỗi và chớ xem nhẹ nó.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Book of Hebrews, found in the New Testament of the Christian Bible, is a remarkable and deeply theological work that addresses an early Christian audience, particularly those of Jewish background. Although the author of Hebrews remains anonymous, the text is notable for its emphasis on the superiority of Jesus Christ and the New Covenant over the Old Covenant and the Judaic religious traditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hebrews serves as a bridge between the Old and New Testaments, drawing on rich Jewish traditions while explaining the transformative nature of Jesus as the ultimate high priest and the fulfillment of God’s promises. The book eloquently presents the theme of Christ’s supremacy, portraying Him as the mediator of a superior covenant and the ultimate source of salvation. Throughout its chapters, Hebrews offers profound theological insights, practical exhortations, and encouragement to its readers, emphasizing the vital role of faith and perseverance in the face of trials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book, with its unique and profound perspective on the role of Jesus in the Christian faith, continues to be a source of inspiration and spiritual insight for believers seeking a deeper understanding of the relationship between the Old and New Covenants in the context of their faith.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sách Hê-bơ-rơ, nằm trong phần Tân Ước của Kinh Thánh, là một tác phẩm đáng chú ý và sâu sắc về thần học, nhắm vào những tín hữu gốc Do Thái trong hội thánh ban đầu. Mặc dù tác giả của Hê-bơ-rơ vẫn giữ tính cách nặc danh, nhưng văn bản này nổi tiếng vì sự nhấn mạnh về sự siêu việt của Chúa Giê-su Christ và Giao Ước Mới so với Giao Ước Cũ và các truyền thống tôn giáo Do Thái.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hê-bơ-rơ đóng vai trò giải thích sự chuyển đổi từ Tân sang Cựu Ước, đối chiếu quyền năng biến đổi của Chúa Giê-su, trong vai trò thầy tế lễ cao cả nhất và là Đấng làm trọn những lời hữa của Đức Chúa Trời, với truyền thống của Do-thái giáo. Sách này trình bày cách hùng hồn sự siêu việt của Đấng Christ, mô tả Ngài là Đấng trung bảo của một giao ước siêu việt hơn và là con đường tối hậu đưa đến sự cứu rỗi. Trong suốt những chương của sách, Hê-bơ-rơ mang đến những chân lý nền tảng sâu nhiệm, những ứng dụng thực tiễn và khích lệ cho người đọc, nhấn mạnh tầm quan trọng của đức tin và đức tính kiên trì trước những thử thách.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sách này, với góc nhìn độc đáo và sâu sắc về vai trò của Chúa Giê-su trong niềm tin, vẫn là một nguồn cảm hứng và hiểu biết tâm linh cho những tín hữu muốn tìm hiểu sâu xa hơn về mối quan hệ giữa Giao Ước Cũ và Giao Ước Mới trong bối cảnh niềm tin của họ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;john-181-40&quot;&gt;JOHN 18:1-40&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://vacsf.org/assets/images/John-teaser.jpg&quot; style=&quot;border: 0px none; margin: 7px 15px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 148px; padding: 0px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(159, 29, 33);&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;               &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; When he had said these things, Jesus went out with his disciples across the Kidron Valley. There was an orchard there, and he and his disciples went into it.  &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (Now Judas, the one who betrayed him, knew the place too, because Jesus had met there many times with his disciples.)  &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; So Judas obtained a squad of soldiers and some officers of the chief priests and Pharisees. They came to the orchard with lanterns and torches and weapons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; Then Jesus, because he knew everything that was going to happen to him, came and asked them, &quot;Who are you looking for?&quot;  &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; They replied, &quot;Jesus the Nazarene.&quot; He told them, &quot;I am he.&quot; (Now Judas, the one who betrayed him, was standing there with them.)  &lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; So when Jesus said to them, &quot;I am he,&quot; they retreated and fell to the ground.  &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; Then Jesus asked them again, &quot;Who are you looking for?&quot; And they said, &quot;Jesus the Nazarene.&quot;  &lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; Jesus replied, &quot;I told you that I am he. If you are looking for me, let these men go.&quot;  &lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; He said this to fulfill the word he had spoken, &quot;&lt;strong&gt;I have not lost a single one of those whom you gave me&lt;/strong&gt;.&quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, pulled it out and struck the high priest's slave, cutting off his right ear. (Now the slave's name was Malchus.)  &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; But Jesus said to Peter, &quot;Put your sword back into its sheath! Am I not to drink the cup that the Father has given me?&quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; Then the squad of soldiers with their commanding officer and the officers of the Jewish leaders arrested Jesus and tied him up.  &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; They brought him first to Annas, for he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was high priest that year.  &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; (Now it was Caiaphas who had advised the Jewish leaders that it was to their advantage that one man die for the people.) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; Simon Peter and another disciple followed them as they brought Jesus to Annas. (Now the other disciple was acquainted with the high priest, and he went with Jesus into the high priest's courtyard.)  &lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; But Simon Peter was left standing outside by the door. So the other disciple who was acquainted with the high priest came out and spoke to the slave girl who watched the door, and brought Peter inside.  &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt; The girl who was the doorkeeper said to Peter, &quot;You're not one of this man's disciples too, are you?&quot; He replied, &quot;I am not.&quot;  &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; (Now the slaves and the guards were standing around a charcoal fire they had made, warming themselves because it was cold. Peter also was standing with them, warming himself.) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt; While this was happening, the high priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and about his teaching.  &lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; Jesus replied, &quot;I have spoken publicly to the world. I always taught in the synagogues and in the temple courts, where all the Jewish people assemble together. I have said nothing in secret.  &lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt; Why do you ask me? Ask those who heard what I said. They know what I said.&quot;  &lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt; When Jesus had said this, one of the high priest's officers who stood nearby struck him on the face and said, &quot;Is that the way you answer the high priest?&quot;  &lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; Jesus replied, &quot;If I have said something wrong, confirm what is wrong. But if I spoke correctly, why strike me?&quot;  &lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt; Then Annas sent him, still tied up, to Caiaphas the high priest. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt; Meanwhile Simon Peter was standing in the courtyard warming himself. They said to him, &quot;You aren't one of his disciples too, are you?&quot; Peter denied it: &quot;I am not!&quot;  &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt; One of the high priest's slaves, a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, said, &quot;Did I not see you in the orchard with him?&quot;  &lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt; Then Peter denied it again, and immediately a rooster crowed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt; Then they brought Jesus from Caiaphas to the Roman governor's residence. (Now it was very early morning.) They did not go into the governor's residence so they would not be ceremonially defiled, but could eat the Passover meal.  &lt;sup&gt;29&lt;/sup&gt; So Pilate came outside to them and said, &quot;What accusation do you bring against this man?&quot;  &lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt; They replied, &quot;If this man were not a criminal, we would not have handed him over to you.&quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt; Pilate told them, &quot;Take him yourselves and pass judgment on him according to your own law!&quot; The Jewish leaders replied, &quot;We cannot legally put anyone to death.&quot;  &lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt; (This happened to fulfill the word Jesus had spoken when he indicated what kind of death he was going to die. )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt; So Pilate went back into the governor's residence, summoned Jesus, and asked him, &quot;Are you the king of the Jews?&quot; &lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt; Jesus replied, &quot;Are you saying this on your own initiative, or have others told you about me?&quot;  &lt;sup&gt;35&lt;/sup&gt; Pilate answered, &quot;I am not a Jew, am I? Your own people and your chief priests handed you over to me. What have you done?&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt; Jesus replied, &quot;My kingdom is not from this world. If my kingdom were from this world, my servants would be fighting to keep me from being handed over to the Jewish authorities. But as it is, my kingdom is not from here.&quot;  &lt;sup&gt;37&lt;/sup&gt; Then Pilate said, &quot;So you are a king!&quot; Jesus replied, &quot;You say that I am a king. For this reason I was born, and for this reason I came into the world - to testify to the truth. Everyone who belongs to the truth listens to my voice.&quot;  &lt;sup&gt;38&lt;/sup&gt; Pilate asked, &quot;What is truth?&quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
When he had said this he went back outside to the Jewish leaders and announced, &quot;I find no basis for an accusation against him.  &lt;sup&gt;39&lt;/sup&gt; But it is your custom that I release one prisoner for you at the Passover. So do you want me to release for you the king of the Jews?&quot;  &lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt; Then they shouted back, &quot;Not this man, but Barabbas!&quot; (Now Barabbas was a revolutionary. )   
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (John 18:1-40)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;not-one-is-lost&quot;&gt;NOT ONE IS LOST&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(159, 29, 33);&quot;&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; Jesus replied, “I told you that I am he. If you are looking for me, let these men go.”  &lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; He said this to fulfill the word he had spoken, “&lt;strong&gt;I have not lost a single one of those whom you gave me&lt;/strong&gt;.” &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (John 18:8-9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this juncture, John’s comprehension of Jesus’ words implied that none of his disciples would face physical loss. However, as history later revealed, all of them would indeed lose their lives, yet none of them would experience spiritual loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll leave it to the reader to delve into the rest of this book, the Gospel of John. However, there is a significant section in Chapter 21 where Jesus questions Peter about his love, but this topic has already been discussed in Chapter 15 under the “Bear Fruit” section, so I believe it’s unnecessary to delve into it further.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(159, 29, 33);&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;             &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; When Jesus had finished saying these things, he looked upward to heaven and said, &quot;Father, &lt;strong&gt;the time has come. Glorify your Son&lt;/strong&gt;, so that your Son may glorify you -  &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; just as you have given him authority over all humanity, so that he may give eternal life to everyone you have given him.  &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Now this is eternal life - that they &lt;u&gt;know&lt;/u&gt; you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you sent&lt;/strong&gt;.  &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;u&gt;I glorified you on earth by &lt;strong&gt;completing the work&lt;/strong&gt; you gave me to do&lt;/u&gt;.  &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; And now, Father, glorify me at your side with the glory I had with you before the world was created. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; &quot;I have revealed your name to the men you gave me out of the world. &lt;strong&gt;They belonged to you, and you gave them to me, and they have obeyed your word&lt;/strong&gt;.  &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; Now they understand that &lt;u&gt;everything&lt;/u&gt; you have given me comes &lt;strong&gt;from you&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; because I have given them the words you have given me. They accepted them and really understand that I came from you, and they believed that you sent me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;   &lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; I am praying on behalf of them. I am not praying on behalf of the world, but on behalf of those you have given me, because they belong to you.  &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; Everything I have belongs to you, and everything you have belongs to me, and I have been glorified by them.  &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; I am no longer in the world, but they are in the world, and I am coming to you. Holy Father, keep them safe in your name that you have given me, so that they may be one just as we are one.  &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; When I was with them I kept them safe and watched over them in your name that you have given me. &lt;strong&gt;Not one of them was lost except the one destined for destruction, so that the scripture could be fulfilled&lt;/strong&gt;.  &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; But now I am coming to you, and I am saying these things in the world, so they may experience my joy completed in themselves.  &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; I have given them your word, and the world has hated them, because they do not belong to the world, just as I do not belong to the world.  &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; I am not asking you to take them out of the world, but that you keep them &lt;strong&gt;safe from the evil one&lt;/strong&gt;.  &lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; They do not belong to the world just as I do not belong to the world.  &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Set them apart in the truth; your word is truth&lt;/strong&gt;.  &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; Just as you sent me into the world, so I sent them into the world.  &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt; And I set myself apart on their behalf, so that they too may be truly set apart. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; &quot;&lt;strong&gt;I am not praying only on their behalf, but also on behalf of those who believe in me through their testimony&lt;/strong&gt;,  &lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt; that they will all be one, just as you, Father, are in me and I am in you. I pray that they will be in us, so that the world will believe that you sent me.  &lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt; The glory you gave to me I have given to them, that they may be one just as we are one -  &lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; I in them and you in me - that they may be completely one, so that the world will know that you sent me, and you have loved them just as you have loved me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt; &quot;Father, I want those you have given me to be with me where I am, so that they can see my glory that you gave me because you loved me before the creation of the world .  &lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt; Righteous Father, even if the world does not know you, I know you, and these men know that you sent me.  &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt; I made known your name to them, and I will continue to make it known, so that the love you have loved me with may be in them, and I may be in them.&quot;  
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (John 17:1-26)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;jesus-glory&quot;&gt;JESUS’ GLORY&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(159, 29, 33);&quot;&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; When Jesus had finished saying these things, he looked upward to heaven and said, “Father, &lt;strong&gt;the time has come. Glorify your Son&lt;/strong&gt;, so that your Son may glorify you -  &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; just as you have given him authority over all humanity, so that he may give eternal life to everyone you have given him. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (John 17:1-2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although &lt;em&gt;“The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of his hands,”&lt;/em&gt; (Psalms 19:1), the glory manifested through creation is dwarfed by the glory yet to come. It won’t be a visual spectacle like the creation of galaxies and stars, but it will be deeply felt in the hearts of lost sinners yearning for God’s grace and mercy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who could have fathomed that God would be glorified as Jesus willingly heads to the cross to redeem sinful humanity?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;knowing-god&quot;&gt;KNOWING GOD&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(159, 29, 33);&quot;&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Now this is eternal life - that they &lt;u&gt;know&lt;/u&gt; you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you sent&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (John 17:3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rich young ruler in Matthew 19, Nicodemus in John 3, the lawyer in Luke 10, and the crowd in Capernaum after witnessing the miracle of feeding thousands in John 6, all approached Jesus with the same fundamental question: how can they obtain eternal life? Jesus responds to their inquiries in an unexpected manner: by emphasizing the importance of knowing God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In John 14, Jesus offers insight into how to develop this knowledge of God the Father, emphasizing that knowing Him equates to knowing God the Father.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If you have known me, you will know my Father too. And from now on you do know him and have seen him. (John 14:7)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what is the path to understanding Jesus better? Some might suggest that getting to know Jesus involves reading the Bible. Nevertheless, it’s important to note that many individuals read the Bible without truly grasping His presence within it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;39&lt;/sup&gt;You study the scriptures thoroughly because you think in them you possess eternal life, and it is these same scriptures that testify about me,  &lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt; but you are not willing to come to me so that you may have life.  … &lt;sup&gt;45&lt;/sup&gt; “Do not suppose that I will accuse you before the Father. The one who accuses you is Moses, in whom you have placed your hope.  &lt;sup&gt;46&lt;/sup&gt; If you believed Moses, you would believe me, because he wrote about me.  &lt;sup&gt;47&lt;/sup&gt; But if you do not believe what Moses wrote, how will you believe my words?” (John 5:39-40,45-47)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moses symbolizes the law, and according to the teachings in Galatians, the purpose of the law is to guide us to Christ and ends its involvement there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;Thus the law had become our guardian until Christ, so that we could be declared righteous by faith.  &lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt; But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a guardian.  &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;6 For in Christ Jesus you are all sons of God through faith. (Galatians 3:24-26)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you remain under the guidance of the law, you will not come to know Christ, and consequently, you will not come to know God either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;jesus-work&quot;&gt;JESUS’ WORK&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(159, 29, 33);&quot;&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; I glorified you on earth by &lt;strong&gt;completing the work&lt;/strong&gt; you gave me to do.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (John 17:4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus brought glory to his Father by fulfilling the task assigned to him, which was to offer himself on the cross for the sins of humanity. This might prompt you to wonder what kind of work you can do to bring glory to God, similar to what Jesus did. Jesus provides the answer in the following verses:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When people asked him, “What must we do to perform the works God requires?” Jesus responded, “The work of God is this: &lt;strong&gt;to believe in the one he has sent&lt;/strong&gt;.” (John 6:28-29)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mission of Jesus is to make the ultimate sacrifice on the cross for the sins of humanity. Your role is to place your faith in the redemptive work He has accomplished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;belonging-to-god&quot;&gt;BELONGING TO GOD&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(159, 29, 33);&quot;&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; “I have revealed your name to the men you gave me out of the world. &lt;strong&gt;They belonged to you, and you gave them to me, and they have obeyed your word&lt;/strong&gt;.  &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; Now they understand that &lt;u&gt;everything&lt;/u&gt; you have given me comes &lt;strong&gt;from you&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; because I have given them the words you have given me. They accepted them and really understand that I came from you, and they believed that you sent me.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (John 17:6-8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While someone might be fortunate enough to have a strong and positive relationship with their earthly father, this doesn’t automatically guarantee a close or trusting connection with our heavenly Father. Therefore, many of us tend to approach God the Father through an intermediary, and in this case, that intermediary is Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The passage mentioned above carries a profound revelation for me: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“They belonged to you.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; This realization deeply moved me, as it signifies a wonderful truth. While Jesus served as my mediator before I placed my trust in God through him, I now understand that I belonged to the Father even before I knew Him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This understanding sheds light on the fact that &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“everything [God] has given [Christ] originates from [God Himself].”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; This includes my very existence and identity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;none-was-lost&quot;&gt;NONE WAS LOST&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(159, 29, 33);&quot;&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; When I was with them I kept them safe and watched over them in your name that you have given me. &lt;strong&gt;Not one of them was lost except the one destined for destruction, so that the scripture could be fulfilled&lt;/strong&gt;. … &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; I am not asking you to take them out of the world, but that you keep them &lt;strong&gt;safe from the evil one&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (John 17:12,15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though they all lost their lives as followers of Christ, none of them lost their faith and hope in Him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sanctified-by-the-word&quot;&gt;SANCTIFIED BY THE WORD&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(159, 29, 33);&quot;&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Set them apart in the truth; your word is truth&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (John 17:17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The term “set apart” is occasionally translated as “sanctified,” which might lead to the interpretation of being made holy. When viewed in this way, it could be misconstrued as believers actively sanctifying themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As indicated in the mentioned verse, believers are indeed set apart or sanctified by the truth found in God’s Word. It’s important to emphasize that this sanctification occurs through faith in Christ and not through any observance of the law or self-driven efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the truths in God’s Word states, &lt;em&gt;“all have sinned and fall short of God’s glory”&lt;/em&gt; (Romans 3:23). This truth doesn’t distinguish you for salvation; it simply informs the whole world that they need a Savior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another truth says, &lt;em&gt;“For no one is declared righteous before him by the works of the law”&lt;/em&gt; (Romans 3:20). Neither does this truth set you apart, but it does inform you of what doesn’t work: the law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The truth overwhelmingly declared throughout Scripture is well represented by John 3:16: &lt;em&gt;“For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that &lt;strong&gt;whoever believes in him&lt;/strong&gt; should not perish but have everlasting life.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are set apart because you &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“believe in him.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is the deed God requires - to believe in the one whom he sent. (John 6:29)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;john-161-33&quot;&gt;JOHN 16:1-33&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://vacsf.org/assets/images/John-teaser.jpg&quot; style=&quot;border: 0px none; margin: 7px 15px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 148px; padding: 0px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(159, 29, 33);&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;            &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; &quot;I have told you all these things so that you will not fall away.  &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;strong&gt;They will put you out of the synagogue&lt;/strong&gt;, yet a time is coming when the one who kills you will think he is offering service to God.  &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; They will do these things because they have not known the Father or me.  &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; But I have told you these things so that when their time comes, you will remember that I told you about them. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;I did not tell you these things from the beginning because I was with you.  &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; But now I am going to the one who sent me, and not one of you is asking me, 'Where are you going?'  &lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; Instead your hearts are filled with sadness because I have said these things to you.  &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; But I tell you the truth, it is to your advantage that I am going away. For if I do not go away, the Advocate will not come to you, but if I go, I will send him to you.  &lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; And &lt;strong&gt;when he comes, he will prove the world wrong concerning sin and righteousness and judgment -  &lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; concerning sin, because they do not believe in me;  &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; concerning righteousness, because I am going to the Father and you will see me no longer;  &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; and concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world has been condemned&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; &quot;I have many more things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now.  &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; But &lt;strong&gt;when he, the Spirit of truth, comes, he will guide you into all truth&lt;/strong&gt;. For he will not speak on his own authority, but will speak whatever he hears, and will tell you what is to come.  &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; He will glorify me, because he will receive from me what is mine and will tell it to you.  &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; Everything that the Father has is mine; that is why I said the Spirit will receive from me what is mine and will tell it to you.  &lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;strong&gt;In a little while you will see me no longer; again after a little while, you will see me&lt;/strong&gt;.&quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt; Then some of his disciples said to one another, &quot;What is the meaning of what he is saying, 'In a little while you will not see me; again after a little while, you will see me,' and, 'because I am going to the Father'?&quot;  &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; So they kept on repeating, &quot;What is the meaning of what he says, 'In a little while'? We do not understand what he is talking about.&quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt; Jesus could see that they wanted to ask him about these things, so he said to them, &quot;Are you asking each other about this - that I said, 'In a little while you will not see me; again after a little while, you will see me'?  &lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;strong&gt;I tell you the solemn truth, you will weep and wail, but the world will rejoice; you will be sad, but your sadness will turn into joy&lt;/strong&gt;.  &lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt; When a woman gives birth, she has distress because her time has come, but when her child is born, she no longer remembers the suffering because of her joy that a human being has been born into the world.  &lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt; So also you have sorrow now, but I will see you again, and your hearts will rejoice, and no one will take your joy away from you.  &lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; At that time you will ask me nothing. I tell you the solemn truth, &lt;strong&gt;whatever you ask the Father in my name he will give you.  &lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt; Until now you have not asked for anything in my name. Ask and you will receive it, so that your joy may be complete&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt; &quot;&lt;strong&gt;I have told you these things in obscure figures of speech; a time is coming when I will no longer speak to you in obscure figures, but will tell you plainly about the Father.  &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt; At that time you will ask in my name, and I do not say that I will ask the Father on your behalf.  &lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt; For the Father himself loves you, because you have loved me and have believed that I came from God&lt;/strong&gt;.  &lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt; I came from the Father and entered into the world, but in turn, I am leaving the world and going back to the Father.&quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;sup&gt;29&lt;/sup&gt; His disciples said, &quot;Look, now you are speaking plainly and not in obscure figures of speech!  &lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt; Now we know that you know everything and do not need anyone to ask you anything. Because of this we believe that you have come from God.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt; Jesus replied, &quot;Do you now believe?  &lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt; Look, a time is coming - and has come - when you will be scattered, each one to his own home, and I will be left alone. Yet I am not alone, because my Father is with me.  &lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;strong&gt;I have told you these things so that in me you may have peace. In the world you have trouble and suffering, but take courage - I have conquered the world&lt;/strong&gt;.&quot;  
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (John 16:1-33)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;persecution&quot;&gt;PERSECUTION&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(159, 29, 33);&quot;&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; “I have told you all these things so that you will not fall away.  &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;strong&gt;They will put you out of the synagogue&lt;/strong&gt;, yet a time is coming when the one who kills you will think he is offering service to God. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (John 16:1-2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Jewish Christians, being expelled from the synagogue could be an incredibly distressing ordeal, but this situation can also be applied to individuals in different regions of the world. Jesus is providing an advance notice of the forthcoming persecutions that believers will face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;when-the-spirit-comes&quot;&gt;WHEN THE SPIRIT COMES&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(159, 29, 33);&quot;&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; But I tell you the truth, it is to your advantage that I am going away. For if I do not go away, the Advocate will not come to you, but if I go, I will send him to you.  &lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; And &lt;strong&gt;when he comes, he will prove the world wrong concerning sin and righteousness and judgment -  &lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; concerning sin, because they do not believe in me;  &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; concerning righteousness, because I am going to the Father and you will see me no longer;  &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; and concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world has been condemned&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; “I have many more things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now.  &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; But &lt;strong&gt;when he, the Spirit of truth, comes, he will guide you into all truth&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (John 16:7-13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world, including many Christians, often holds mistaken beliefs regarding three fundamental concepts: sin, righteousness, and judgment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frequently, people attempt to address the problem of sin by imposing behavioral regulations. The Old Covenant commandments are often employed to restrain the sinful inclinations of human nature. This leads to a pertinent question: if the Ten Commandments could effectively curb sinful behavior, why did Christ need to come? The truth is that the law was never intended to resolve the issue of sin; instead, its purpose is to reveal the hopeless state of sinners until they encounter Christ. Paradoxically, the law can actually exacerbate our sinful tendencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But sin, seizing the opportunity through the commandment, produced in me all kinds of wrong desires. For apart from the law, sin is dead. (Romans 7:8)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, the Holy Spirit seeks to correct your perception of sin. The central sin in question is unbelief, rather than particular deeds or failures to act: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“when he comes, he will prove the world wrong concerning sin, … because they do not believe in me.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;righteousness&quot;&gt;Righteousness&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Righteousness is essentially the flip side of the “sin” coin, representing the absence of sin. In much the same way people misconceive sin, they also misunderstand righteousness, often using the same approach to attain it as they do with sin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, once more, it is when Jesus goes to the Father that He establishes your righteousness, not because you somehow manage to maintain good behavior and avoid wrongdoing. Romans 3:22 describes this righteousness as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This righteousness is granted through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe. (Romans 3:22)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s important to note that this righteousness is granted through faith in Christ, not through the works of the law, as indicated by:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;No one is declared righteous before Him by the works of the law. (Romans 3:20)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;judgement&quot;&gt;Judgement&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many believers often associate judgment with a future event at the end of time when Christ returns to pass judgment on the world. However, the judgment that Jesus is referring to here seems to pertain to the present, at least since Jesus returned to heaven and the Holy Spirit took His place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the Holy Spirit finds it necessary to correct the world’s perception of judgment: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“When he comes, he will prove the world wrong … concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world has been condemned.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, this judgment is directed at the ruler of this world, specifically Satan, and not against the world’s inhabitants. Jesus himself affirms this by saying: &lt;em&gt;“For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world should be saved through him.”&lt;/em&gt; (John 3:17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-second-coming&quot;&gt;THE SECOND COMING&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(159, 29, 33);&quot;&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;strong&gt;In a little while you will see me no longer; again after a little while, you will see me&lt;/strong&gt;. … &lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;strong&gt;I tell you the solemn truth, you will weep and wail, but the world will rejoice; you will be sad, but your sadness will turn into joy&lt;/strong&gt;. … &lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;strong&gt;I have told you these things so that in me you may have peace. In the world you have trouble and suffering, but take courage - I have conquered the world&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (John 16:16,20,33)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take comfort in the words of Jesus spoken here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whatever-you-ask&quot;&gt;WHATEVER YOU ASK&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; At that time you will ask me nothing. I tell you the solemn truth, &lt;strong&gt;whatever you ask the Father in my name he will give you.  &lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt; Until now you have not asked for anything in my name. Ask and you will receive it, so that your joy may be complete&lt;/strong&gt;. … &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt; At that time you will ask in my name, and I do not say that I will ask the Father on your behalf.  &lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;strong&gt;For the Father himself loves you&lt;/strong&gt;, because you have loved me and have believed that I came from God.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (John 16:23-24,26-27)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding “whatever you ask,” this topic has already been discussed in the study notes for chapter 14 under the “Whatever you ask” subtopic. However, there is a subtle point that Jesus makes in verse 27. He adds, &lt;em&gt;“&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;At that time you will ask in my name, and I do not say that I will ask the Father on your behalf. &lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;strong&gt;For the Father himself loves you&lt;/strong&gt;, because you have loved me and have believed that I came from God.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This statement emphasizes that the Father’s love for you is so profound that Jesus doesn’t need to intercede on your behalf when you ask in his name. It signifies the removal of any mediator between you and God. This concept aligns with Hebrews 4:16: &lt;em&gt;“Therefore let us confidently approach the throne of grace to receive mercy and find grace whenever we need help.”&lt;/em&gt; The throne of grace, once restricted to the Holy of Holies and accessible only to the High Priest once a year under the Old Covenant, is now fully available to all of us since the curtain separating us from the Most Holy Place was torn from the top when Jesus declared, &lt;em&gt;“It is finished.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

He prunes every branch that bears fruit so that it will bear more fruit&lt;/strong&gt;.  &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; You are &lt;strong&gt;clean already because of the word&lt;/strong&gt; that I have spoken to you.  &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Remain in me, and I will remain in you&lt;/strong&gt;. Just as the branch cannot bear fruit by itself, unless it remains in the vine, so neither can you unless you remain in me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; &quot;&lt;strong&gt;I am the vine; you are the branches. The one who remains in me - and I in him - bears much fruit&lt;/strong&gt;, because apart from me you can accomplish nothing.  &lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; If anyone does not remain in me, he is thrown out like a branch, and dries up; and such branches are gathered up and thrown into the fire, and are burned up.  &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;strong&gt;If you remain in me and my words remain in you, ask whatever you want, and it will be done for you&lt;/strong&gt;.  &lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; My Father is honored by this, that you bear much fruit and show that you are my disciples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; &quot;Just as the Father has loved me, I have also loved you; remain in my love.  &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;strong&gt;If you obey my commandments, you will remain in my love, just as I have obeyed my Father's commandments and remain in his love&lt;/strong&gt;.  &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; I have told you these things so that my joy may be in you, and your joy may be complete.  &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;strong&gt;My commandment is this - to love one another just as I have loved you.  &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; No one has greater love than this - that one lays down his life for his friends&lt;/strong&gt;.  &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; You are my friends if you do what I command you.  &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; I no longer call you slaves, because the slave does not understand what his master is doing. But I have called you friends, because I have revealed to you everything I heard from my Father.  &lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you to go and bear fruit, fruit that remains, so that whatever you ask the Father in my name he will give you.  &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;strong&gt;This I command you - to love one another&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; &quot;If the world hates you, be aware that it hated me first.  &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt; If you belonged to the world, the world would love you as its own. However, because you do not belong to the world, but I chose you out of the world, for this reason the world hates you.  &lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; Remember what I told you, 'A slave is not greater than his master.' If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you. If they obeyed my word, they will obey yours too.  &lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt; But they will do all these things to you on account of my name, because they do not know the one who sent me.  &lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt; If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not be guilty of sin. But they no longer have any excuse for their sin.  &lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; The one who hates me hates my Father too.  &lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;strong&gt;If I had not performed among them the miraculous deeds that no one else did, they would not be guilty of sin. But now they have seen the deeds and have hated both me and my Father&lt;/strong&gt;.  &lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt; Now this happened to fulfill the word that is written in their law, 'They hated me without reason.'  &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt; When the Advocate comes, whom I will send you from the Father - the Spirit of truth who goes out from the Father - he will testify about me,  &lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt; and you also will testify, because you have been with me from the beginning.  
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (John 15:1-27)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

He &lt;strong&gt;prunes&lt;/strong&gt; every branch that &lt;strong&gt;bears fruit&lt;/strong&gt; so that it will bear more fruit. … &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; “I am the vine; you are the branches. The one who &lt;strong&gt;remains in me - and I in him - bears much fruit&lt;/strong&gt;. … &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; If you &lt;strong&gt;obey my commandments, you will remain in my love&lt;/strong&gt;, just as I have obeyed my Father’s commandments and remain in his love. … &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;strong&gt;My commandment is this - to love one another just as I have loved you.  &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; No one has greater love than this - that one lays down his life for his friends&lt;/strong&gt;.  &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (John 15:1-2,5,10,12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter introduces several key concepts, including cutting and pruning, bearing fruit, remaining in Christ, obeying the commandments, and loving one another. These concepts are interconnected, and I’m aiming to interpret the entire chapter under the theme of “Bearing Fruit.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The progression of ideas in this chapter emphasizes the central concept of bearing fruit, as evidenced by the frequent repetition of the word &lt;em&gt;“fruit”&lt;/em&gt; (eight times). The subsequent concepts presented in the chapter guide us on how to effectively “bear fruit” for God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initial condition for bearing fruit is our connection as branches to the vine, which is Christ. To maintain this connection, we must abide in Him. However, abiding in Him necessitates obedience to His commandments. His primary commandment is that we love one another, just as He has loved us. And how did He love us? He demonstrated His love by laying down His life for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s delve into the depth of the love commandment that Jesus imparts to us. He employs the Greek word “agape,” signifying the highest form of love, a love that only God can fully exemplify.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Jesus questioned Peter three times about his love, we observe an intriguing interaction. In the first two instances, Jesus inquired if Peter “agape” Him, but Peter responded with “phileo,” a type of affection associated with friendship, distinct from the profound “agape” love. Surprisingly, in the third inquiry, Jesus adapted to Peter’s level and employed the term “phileo,” to which Peter comfortably replied with affirmation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Jesus attaches a crucial qualifier to this love commandment: “just as I have loved you.” It’s the “agape” love that Jesus is asking of us. Can any of us confidently assert that we are prepared to lay down our lives for our brethren? Even if we were placed in a situation demanding such sacrifice, we would remain imperfect offerings, unacceptable to God, as only Jesus stands as the flawless Lamb of God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, the question arises: why would Jesus give us a commandment that seems impossible to obey? The answer to this question is rather straightforward. At this point in time, the Old Covenant is still in effect because Jesus has not yet gone to the cross to inaugurate the New Covenant. He is still emphasizing to people the futility of trying to attain God’s righteousness through obedience to the commandments. Although Jesus’ disciples have been with Him for some time, they have not fully grasped His plan for saving humanity from their sins and reconciling them to God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s fast-forward to the book of Galatians to gain insight into how the Apostle Paul explains the purpose behind Jesus reiterating the role of the law:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;Now &lt;u&gt;before faith came&lt;/u&gt; we were held in &lt;u&gt;custody under the law, being kept as prisoners until the coming faith would be revealed&lt;/u&gt;.  &lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt; Thus the law had become &lt;u&gt;our guardian until Christ, so that we could be declared righteous by faith&lt;/u&gt;. (Galatians 3:23-24)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, many Christians don’t see this transition between the covenants, they don’t see that the law must stop being their guardian when Christ came. They become lukewarm Christians who serve two masters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, how can you continue to abide in Christ in order to bear fruit? You achieve this by approaching Christ in faith instead of clinging to the guidance of your former guardian, the law.&lt;/p&gt;

You believe in God; believe also in me.  &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; There are many dwelling places in my Father's house. Otherwise, I would have told you, because &lt;strong&gt;I am going away to make ready a place for you.  &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; And if I go and make ready a place for you, I will come again and take you to be with me, so that where I am you may be too&lt;/strong&gt;.  &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; And you know the way where I am going.&quot;  &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; Thomas said, &quot;Lord, we don't know where you are going. How can we know the way?&quot;  &lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; Jesus replied, &lt;strong&gt;&quot;I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.  &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; If you have known me, you will know my Father too. And from now on you do know him and have seen him.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; Philip said, &quot;&lt;strong&gt;Lord, show us the Father&lt;/strong&gt;, and we will be content.&quot;  &lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; Jesus replied, &quot;Have I been with you for so long, and you have not known me, Philip? How can you say, 'Show us the Father'?  &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father is in me? The words that I say to you, I do not speak on my own initiative, but &lt;strong&gt;the Father residing in me performs his miraculous deeds&lt;/strong&gt;.  &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father is in me, but if you do not believe me, believe because of the miraculous deeds themselves.  &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;strong&gt;I tell you the solemn truth, the person who believes in me will perform the miraculous deeds that I am doing, and will perform greater deeds than these, because I am going to the Father.  &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; And I will do whatever you ask in my name, so that the Father may be glorified in the Son.  &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; If you ask me anything in my name, I will do it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; &quot;&lt;strong&gt;If you love me, you will obey my commandments.  &lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; Then I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Advocate to be with you forever&lt;/strong&gt; -  &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt; the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot accept, because it does not see him or know him. But you know him, because he resides with you and will be in you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; &quot;I will not abandon you as orphans, I will come to you.  &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt; In a little while the world will not see me any longer, but you will see me; because I live, you will live too.  &lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; You will know at that time that I am in my Father and you are in me and I am in you.  &lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt; The person who has my commandments and obeys them is the one who loves me. The one who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I will love him and will reveal myself to him.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt; &quot;Lord,&quot; Judas (not Judas Iscariot) said, &quot;what has happened that you are going to reveal yourself to us and not to the world?&quot;  &lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; Jesus replied, &quot;If anyone loves me, he will obey my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and take up residence with him.  &lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt; The person who does not love me does not obey my words. And the word you hear is not mine, but the Father's who sent me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt; &quot;I have spoken these things while staying with you.  &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt; But &lt;strong&gt;the Advocate, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you everything, and will cause you to remember everything I said to you&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt; &quot;Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you; I do not give it to you as the world does. Do not let your hearts be distressed or lacking in courage.  &lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt; You heard me say to you, 'I am going away and I am coming back to you.' If you loved me, you would be glad that I am going to the Father, because the Father is greater than I am.  &lt;sup&gt;29&lt;/sup&gt; I have told you now before it happens, so that when it happens you may believe.  &lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt; I will not speak with you much longer, for the ruler of this world is coming. He has no power over me,  &lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt; but &lt;strong&gt;I am doing just what the Father commanded me, so that the world may know that I love the Father&lt;/strong&gt;. Get up, let us go from here.&quot;  
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (John 14:1-31)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-place-for-you&quot;&gt;A PLACE FOR YOU&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(159, 29, 33);&quot;&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;… I am going away to make ready a place for you.  &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; And if I go and make ready a place for you, I will come again and take you to be with me, so that where I am you may be too&lt;/strong&gt;.  &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (John 14:2-3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These verses can be a great source of comfort for those who may be going through challenging times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;knowing-god&quot;&gt;KNOWING GOD&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(159, 29, 33);&quot;&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; Jesus replied, &lt;strong&gt;“I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.  &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; If you have known me, you will know my Father too. And from now on you do know him and have seen him.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (John 14:6-7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus explains the essence of eternal life in this way: &lt;em&gt;“Now this is eternal life - that they know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you sent.” (John 17:3)&lt;/em&gt; Therefore, based on verse 7, knowing Christ means knowing God the Father. Knowing Christ entails being clothed in His complete righteousness, allowing you to approach God’s throne of grace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;show-us-the-father&quot;&gt;SHOW US THE FATHER&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(159, 29, 33);&quot;&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; Philip said, “&lt;strong&gt;Lord, show us the Father&lt;/strong&gt;, and we will be content.”  &lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; Jesus replied, “Have I been with you for so long, and you have not known me, Philip? How can you say, ‘Show us the Father’?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (John 14:8-9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interpretation aligns with the one provided in the “Knowing God” section above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ask-me-anything&quot;&gt;ASK ME ANYTHING&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(159, 29, 33);&quot;&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father is in me? The words that I say to you, I do not speak on my own initiative, but &lt;strong&gt;the Father residing in me performs his miraculous deeds&lt;/strong&gt;.  &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father is in me, but if you do not believe me, believe because of the miraculous deeds themselves.  &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;strong&gt;I tell you the solemn truth, the person who believes in me will perform the miraculous deeds that I am doing, and will perform greater deeds than these, because I am going to the Father.  &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; And I will do whatever you ask in my name, so that the Father may be glorified in the Son.  &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; If you ask me anything in my name, I will do it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (John 14:10-14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As indicated in verse 10 above, the miracles that Jesus performed originated from &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“the Father residing in me performs his miraculous deeds.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Nevertheless, the verses mentioned raise a couple of questions for believers. Jesus states that they will accomplish &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“greater deeds”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; than he did, and he also assures them that he will carry out &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“whatever you ask in his name.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;greater-deeds&quot;&gt;Greater deeds&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What actions could be considered greater than the miracles of raising the dead, restoring sight to the blind, and feeding thousands? Perhaps the greater deeds involve guiding others to Christ so they may attain eternal life. During Jesus’ earthly ministry, he performed miraculous acts that impacted physical life. However, during that time, the Holy Spirit had not yet been given to believers. Without the Holy Spirit, there can be no true life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;whatever-you-ask&quot;&gt;Whatever you ask&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus promises that he will fulfill whatever you ask in his name. This is a challenging topic to address, as some individuals or belief systems might take it at face value despite their experiences suggesting otherwise. Certainly, God works miracles quietly in the lives of believers according to His divine providence, but it doesn’t happen every time, and He doesn’t always grant every request. So, how do you resolve this apparent conflict?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is, however, a crucial aspect that can help us navigate this dilemma. Jesus did mention that, in order for Him to answer our requests, we must ask in His name. This raises an important question: what does it mean to ask in His name? Is it simply by saying “In Jesus’ name, Amen?” Or does it involve asserting the authority of believers, if they indeed possess such authority? Could it be that many Christians assume they can stand in Jesus’ name without proper authorization?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it possible for a Christian to be in Jesus’ name when making one request and not be in His name with another? More often than not, they may not truly be in Jesus’ name when making their requests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, could it be that most Christians mistakenly believe they are genuinely in Jesus’ name? To stand in the name of Jesus means to represent Him accurately as He is. Can any human, despite being declared righteous without personal merit, adequately represent the Most High? This might explain why we don’t witness more miracles in the course of our Christian lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stating that you are acting in God’s name is a significant declaration. Contemporary prophets often make proclamations in the name of God, but the peril lies in doing so without explicit divine authorization. Such actions may constitute blasphemy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This could be a subtle way in which Jesus hints at why he doesn’t respond to all our prayers. To make a request in Jesus’ name, the impulse to pray in that manner must originate from God himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, even if God were to grant all our requests, can we be certain that every one of our petitions aligns with His will and His divine plan for our lives? Shouldn’t we trust that the Father knows what is best for us?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subsequent chapters might offer further insight into the implications of acting in Christ’s name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;if-you-obey-my-commandments&quot;&gt;IF YOU OBEY MY COMMANDMENTS&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(159, 29, 33);&quot;&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; “&lt;strong&gt;If you love me, you will obey my commandments.  &lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; Then I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Advocate to be with you forever&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (John 14:15-16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As indicated in these verses, the prerequisite for receiving the Advocate, without whom eternal life is unattainable, is adherence to the commandments. This essentially reiterates what Jesus mentioned in chapter 5, verse 29:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“&lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt;“Do not be amazed at this, because a time is coming when all who are in the tombs will hear his voice &lt;sup&gt;29&lt;/sup&gt;and will come out - the ones who have &lt;strong&gt;done what is good&lt;/strong&gt; to the resurrection resulting in life, and the ones who have &lt;strong&gt;done what is evil&lt;/strong&gt; to the resurrection resulting in condemnation. (John 5:28-29)”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus continues to allude to the Old Covenant to urge them to transition to the New Covenant. If you persist with the Old Covenant, can you have confidence that you will experience a resurrection unto life rather than facing condemnation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The New Covenant simply requires faith in God and the cross:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;“I tell you the solemn truth, the one who hears my message and believes the one who sent me has eternal life and will not be condemned, but has crossed over from death to life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, verse 15 mentioned above pertains only to those who are still under the law. If you believe that you can fully adhere to all of God’s commandments, you are more self-deceived than the young ruler depicted in Mark 10. You may argue that you don’t have to adhere to all of the commandments, only as many as you can manage. However, James warns: &lt;em&gt;“For whoever keeps the whole law but fails in one point has become guilty of all of it”&lt;/em&gt; (James 2:10).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have moved into the New Covenant, you are set free from the constraints of the law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But now we have been released from the law, because we have died to what controlled us, so that we may serve in the new life of the Spirit and not under the old written code. (Romans 7:6)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;john-131-38&quot;&gt;JOHN 13:1-38&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://vacsf.org/assets/images/John-teaser.jpg&quot; style=&quot;border: 0px none; margin: 7px 15px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 148px; padding: 0px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(159, 29, 33);&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;         &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Just before the Passover feast, Jesus knew that his time had come to depart from this world to the Father. Having loved his own who were in the world, he now loved them to the very end.  &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; The evening meal was in progress, and the devil had already put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, that he should betray Jesus.  &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; Because Jesus knew that the Father had handed all things over to him, and that he had come from God and was going back to God,  &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; he got up from the meal, removed his outer clothes, took a towel and tied it around himself.  &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; He poured water into the washbasin and began to wash the disciples' feet and to dry them with the towel he had wrapped around himself. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; Then he came to Simon Peter. Peter said to him, &quot;&lt;strong&gt;Lord, are you going to wash my feet?&lt;/strong&gt;&quot;  &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; Jesus replied, &quot;You do not understand what I am doing now, but you will understand after these things.&quot;  &lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Peter said to him, &quot;You will never wash my feet!&quot; Jesus replied, &quot;If I do not wash you, you have no share with me.&quot;  &lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; Simon Peter said to him, &quot;Lord, wash not only my feet, but also my hands and my head!&quot;  &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; Jesus replied, &quot;The one who has bathed needs only to wash his feet, but is completely clean.&lt;/strong&gt; And you disciples are clean, but not every one of you.&quot;  &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; (For Jesus knew the one who was going to betray him. For this reason he said, &quot;Not every one of you is clean.&quot;) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; So when Jesus had washed their feet and put his outer clothing back on, he took his place at the table again and said to them, &quot;Do you understand what I have done for you?  &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; You call me 'Teacher' and 'Lord,' and do so correctly, for that is what I am.  &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;strong&gt;If I then, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you too ought to wash one another's feet&lt;/strong&gt;.  &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; For I have given you an example - you should do just as I have done for you.  &lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; I tell you the solemn truth, the slave is not greater than his master, nor is the one who is sent as a messenger greater than the one who sent him.  &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt; If you understand these things, you will be blessed if you do them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; &quot;What I am saying does not refer to all of you. I know the ones I have chosen. But this is to fulfill the scripture, 'The one who eats my bread has turned against me.'  &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt; I am telling you this now, before it happens, so that when it happens you may believe that I am he.  &lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; I tell you the solemn truth, whoever accepts the one I send accepts me, and whoever accepts me accepts the one who sent me.&quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt; When he had said these things, Jesus was greatly distressed in spirit, and testified, &quot;I tell you the solemn truth, one of you will betray me.&quot;  &lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt; The disciples began to look at one another, worried and perplexed to know which of them he was talking about.  &lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; One of his disciples, the one Jesus loved, was at the table to the right of Jesus in a place of honor.  &lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt; So Simon Peter gestured to this disciple to ask Jesus who it was he was referring to.  &lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt; Then the disciple whom Jesus loved leaned back against Jesus' chest and asked him, &quot;Lord, who is it?&quot;  &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt; Jesus replied, &quot;It is the one to whom I will give this piece of bread after I have dipped it in the dish.&quot; Then he dipped the piece of bread in the dish and gave it to Judas Iscariot, Simon's son.  &lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;strong&gt;And after Judas took the piece of bread, Satan entered into him&lt;/strong&gt;. Jesus said to him, &quot;What you are about to do, do quickly.&quot;  &lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt; (Now none of those present at the table understood why Jesus said this to Judas.  &lt;sup&gt;29&lt;/sup&gt; Some thought that, because Judas had the money box, Jesus was telling him to buy whatever they needed for the feast, or to give something to the poor.)  &lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt; Judas took the piece of bread and went out immediately. (Now it was night.) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;strong&gt;When Judas had gone out, Jesus said, &quot;Now the Son of Man is glorified&lt;/strong&gt;, and God is glorified in him.  &lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt; If God is glorified in him, God will also glorify him in himself, and he will glorify him right away.  &lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt; Children, I am still with you for a little while. You will look for me, and just as I said to the Jewish religious leaders, 'Where I am going you cannot come,' now I tell you the same. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;strong&gt;I give you a new commandment - to love one another. Just as I have loved you, you also are to love one another.  &lt;sup&gt;35&lt;/sup&gt; Everyone will know by this that you are my disciples - if you have love for one another&lt;/strong&gt;&quot;.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt; Simon Peter said to him, &quot;Lord, where are you going?&quot; Jesus replied, &quot;Where I am going, you cannot follow me now, but you will follow later.&quot;  &lt;sup&gt;37&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Peter said to him, &quot;Lord, why can't I follow you now? I will lay down my life for you!&quot;  &lt;sup&gt;38&lt;/sup&gt; Jesus answered, &quot;Will you lay down your life for me? I tell you the solemn truth, the rooster will not crow until you have denied me three times!&lt;/strong&gt;  
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (John 13:1-38)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;feet-washing&quot;&gt;FEET WASHING&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(159, 29, 33);&quot;&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; Then he came to Simon Peter. Peter said to him, “&lt;strong&gt;Lord, are you going to wash my feet?&lt;/strong&gt;”  &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; Jesus replied, “You do not understand what I am doing now, but you will understand after these things.”  &lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Peter said to him, “You will never wash my feet!” Jesus replied, “If I do not wash you, you have no share with me.”  &lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; Simon Peter said to him, “Lord, wash not only my feet, but also my hands and my head!”  &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; Jesus replied, “The one who has bathed needs only to wash his feet, but is completely clean. … &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;strong&gt;If I then, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you too ought to wash one another’s feet&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (John 13:6-10;14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During my early years as a Christian, a colleague and I enjoyed having lunch together while listening to Dr. J. V. McGee or engaging in discussions that lifted our spirits to heavenly heights. We used to affectionately refer to these gatherings as “feet washing time.” We wondered if it was appropriate to apply the literal act of Jesus washing the disciples’ feet to a more symbolic meaning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Jesus’ act of feet washing appears to address a more profound issue than merely keeping our physical or spiritual feet clean. He stated, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“If I do not wash you, you have no part with me.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; What could this washing signify that is so crucial that without it, one cannot be a part of Jesus?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a previous chapter, John 3, Jesus mentioned being born of water: &lt;em&gt;“I tell you the solemn truth, unless a person is born of water and spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God.”&lt;/em&gt; The significance of water in this context seems to align with its importance in John 13.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In John 15, Jesus clarified the meaning of water further: &lt;em&gt;“You are clean already because of &lt;strong&gt;the word&lt;/strong&gt; that I have spoken to you.”&lt;/em&gt; (John 15:3) In chapter 17, verse 17, Jesus emphasized that it is the word that makes one clean: &lt;em&gt;“Set them apart in the truth; your word is truth.”&lt;/em&gt; (John 17:17) Therefore, by combining John 15:3 and John 17:17 with verse 8 of this chapter, we can conclude that water symbolizes God’s Word, the gospel, the New Covenant, and the new law of the spirit of life, rather than the old law of sin and death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s examine another verse that illustrates the function of the word as water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt; … Christ loved the church and gave himself for her  &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;to sanctify her by cleansing her with the &lt;strong&gt;washing of the water by the word&lt;/strong&gt;,  &lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt;so that he may present the church to himself as glorious - not having a stain or wrinkle, or any such blemish, but holy and blameless. (Ephesians 5:25-27)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s conclude this section with John 15:3: “&lt;em&gt;You are &lt;strong&gt;already clean&lt;/strong&gt; because of &lt;strong&gt;the word&lt;/strong&gt; that I have spoken to you.&lt;/em&gt;” This cleansing is a one-time event, not something that needs to be repeated over and over again. You are already clean. It’s similar to how once you are born of God from above, you don’t need to be reborn repeatedly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can almost deduce that the act of washing one another’s feet is like assisting each other in gaining a better understanding of and finding assurance in their salvation, which aligns with the purpose of our Sunday School class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;entered-by-satan&quot;&gt;ENTERED BY SATAN&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(159, 29, 33);&quot;&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;strong&gt;And after Judas took the piece of bread, Satan entered into him&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (John 13:27)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Satan did not enter Judas Iscariot until after he received the piece of bread from Jesus. We can draw a parallel with the story of Job to speculate about this moment when Satan entered Judas’ heart. While God permitted Satan to test Job’s faith, it can be inferred that God must have allowed Satan’s influence in Judas as well. However, we can be confident that God would not have permitted it if Judas had recognized Jesus as his true master from the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;when-jesus-is-glorified&quot;&gt;WHEN JESUS IS GLORIFIED&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(159, 29, 33);&quot;&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;strong&gt;When Judas had gone out, Jesus said, “Now the Son of Man is glorified&lt;/strong&gt;, and God is glorified in him.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (John 13:31)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as Judas took the piece of bread and departed, Jesus declared, “&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now the Son of Man is glorified.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;” This statement seems to mark the beginning of a sequence of events that ultimately leads to Jesus’ crucifixion. But why does Jesus consider his crucifixion as the time for his glory?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Jesus, as God of the entire universe, doesn’t require glorification, he willingly chose to go to the cross to redeem humanity. He finds delight when his sacrificial act of dying for their sins is accepted and embraced. He doesn’t seek reciprocation from those he died for; in fact, their attempts to repay his kindness could be seen as an affront.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And if it is by grace, it is no longer by works; otherwise, grace would no longer be grace. (Romans 11:6)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where is the glory if those receiving grace could somehow repay the debt?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-new-commandment&quot;&gt;THE NEW COMMANDMENT&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(159, 29, 33);&quot;&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;strong&gt;I give you a new commandment - to love one another. Just as I have loved you, you also are to love one another.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (John 13:34)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This new commandment appears to be similar to the one in Luke 10, but they are from entirely different contexts and target audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind, and love your neighbor as yourself.”” (Luke 10:27)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Luke 10, his target audience is the legal experts of the day, while in John 13, it is his small group of chosen disciples. There are also differences within the commandments themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The commandment in Luke 10 resembles an Old Covenant law, as it includes a requirement to love God, accentuated by the conditional statement in Luke 10:28: &lt;em&gt;“Do this, and you will live.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the commandment in this chapter focuses solely on loving one another. In this context, Jesus’ disciples, having experienced His love, naturally love one another as an expression of their transformed identity in Christ. They are not obligated to love one another as a prerequisite for receiving Christ’s love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lay-down-your-life&quot;&gt;LAY DOWN YOUR LIFE?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(159, 29, 33);&quot;&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt; Simon Peter said to him, “Lord, where are you going?” Jesus replied, “Where I am going, you cannot follow me now, but you will follow later.”  &lt;sup&gt;37&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Peter said to him, “Lord, why can’t I follow you now? I will lay down my life for you!”  &lt;sup&gt;38&lt;/sup&gt; Jesus answered, “Will you lay down your life for me? I tell you the solemn truth, the rooster will not crow until you have denied me three times!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (John 13:36-38)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m sure Peter will later understand this about loving God:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In this is love: not that we have loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the atoning sacrifice for our sins. (I John 4:10)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;john-121-50&quot;&gt;JOHN 12:1-50&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://vacsf.org/assets/images/John-teaser.jpg&quot; style=&quot;border: 0px none; margin: 7px 15px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 148px; padding: 0px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(159, 29, 33);&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;         &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Then, six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus lived, whom he had raised from the dead.  &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; So they prepared a dinner for Jesus there. Martha was serving, and Lazarus was among those present at the table with him.  &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Then Mary took three quarters of a pound of expensive aromatic oil from pure nard and anointed the feet of Jesus. She then wiped his feet dry with her hair&lt;/strong&gt;. (Now the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfumed oil.)  &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; But &lt;strong&gt;Judas Iscariot&lt;/strong&gt;, one of his disciples (the one who was going to betray him) said,  &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; &quot;&lt;strong&gt;Why wasn't this oil sold for three hundred silver coins and the money given to the poor?&lt;/strong&gt;&quot;  &lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; (Now Judas said this not because he was concerned about the poor, but because he was a thief. As keeper of the money box, he used to steal what was put into it.)  &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;strong&gt;So Jesus said, &quot;Leave her alone. She has kept it for the day of my burial&lt;/strong&gt;.  &lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; For you will always have the poor with you, but you will not always have me!&quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; Now a large crowd of Judeans learned that Jesus was there, and so they came not only because of him but also to see Lazarus whom he had raised from the dead.  &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;strong&gt;So the chief priests planned to kill Lazarus too&lt;/strong&gt;,  &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; for on account of him many of the Jewish people from Jerusalem were going away and believing in Jesus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; The next day the large crowd that had come to the feast heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem.  &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; So they took branches of palm trees and went out to meet him. They began to shout, &quot;Hosanna! Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord! Blessed is the king of Israel!&quot;  &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; Jesus found a young donkey and sat on it, just as it is written,  &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; &quot;Do not be afraid, people of Zion; look, your king is coming, seated on a donkey's colt!&quot;  &lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;His disciples did not understand these things when they first happened, but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written about him and that these things had happened to him&lt;/strong&gt;.) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt; So the crowd who had been with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead were continuing to testify about it.  &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; Because they had heard that Jesus had performed this miraculous sign, the crowd went out to meet him.  &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt; Thus the Pharisees said to one another, &quot;You see that you can do nothing. Look, the world has run off after him!&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; Now some Greeks were among those who had gone up to worship at the feast.  &lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt; So these approached Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, and requested, &quot;Sir, we would like to see Jesus.&quot;  &lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt; Philip went and told Andrew, and they both went and told Jesus.  &lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; Jesus replied, &quot;&lt;strong&gt;The time has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.  &lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt; I tell you the solemn truth, unless a kernel of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it remains by itself alone. But if it dies, it produces much grain.  &lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt; The one who loves his life destroys it, and the one who hates his life in this world guards it for eternal life.  &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt; If anyone wants to serve me, he must follow me, and where I am, my servant will be too. If anyone serves me, the Father will honor him&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt; &quot;Now my soul is greatly distressed. And what should I say? 'Father, deliver me from this hour'? No, but for this very reason I have come to this hour.  &lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Father, glorify your name.&quot; Then a voice came from heaven, &quot;I have glorified it, and I will glorify it again&lt;/strong&gt;.&quot;  &lt;sup&gt;29&lt;/sup&gt; The crowd that stood there and heard the voice said that it had thundered. Others said that an angel had spoken to him.  &lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt; Jesus said, &quot;&lt;strong&gt;This voice has not come for my benefit but for yours.  &lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt; Now is the judgment of this world; now the ruler of this world will be driven out.  &lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt; And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself&lt;/strong&gt;.&quot;  &lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt; (Now he said this to indicate clearly what kind of death he was going to die.) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt; Then the crowd responded, &quot;We have heard from the law that the Christ will remain forever. How can you say, 'The Son of Man must be lifted up'? Who is this Son of Man?&quot;  &lt;sup&gt;35&lt;/sup&gt; Jesus replied, &quot;&lt;strong&gt;The light is with you for a little while longer. Walk while you have the light, so that the darkness may not overtake you. The one who walks in the darkness does not know where he is going.  &lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt; While you have the light, believe in the light, so that you may become sons of light&lt;/strong&gt;.&quot; When Jesus had said these things, he went away and hid himself from them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;sup&gt;37&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Although Jesus had performed so many miraculous signs before them, they still refused to believe in him&lt;/strong&gt;,  &lt;sup&gt;38&lt;/sup&gt; so that the word of Isaiah the prophet would be fulfilled. He said, &quot;Lord, who has believed our message, and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?&quot;  &lt;sup&gt;39&lt;/sup&gt; For this reason they could not believe, because again Isaiah said,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&quot;He has blinded their eyes &lt;br /&gt;and hardened their heart, &lt;br /&gt;so that they would not see with their eyes &lt;br /&gt;and understand with their heart, &lt;br /&gt;and turn to me, and I would heal them.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;sup&gt;41&lt;/sup&gt; Isaiah said these things because he saw Christ's glory, and spoke about him. &lt;sup&gt;42&lt;/sup&gt; Nevertheless, even among the rulers many believed in him, but because of the Pharisees they would not confess Jesus to be the Christ, &lt;strong&gt;so that they would not be put out of the synagogue.  &lt;sup&gt;43&lt;/sup&gt; For they loved praise from men more than praise from God&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;sup&gt;44&lt;/sup&gt; But Jesus shouted out, &quot;The one who believes in me does not believe in me, but in the one who sent me,  &lt;sup&gt;45&lt;/sup&gt; and the one who sees me sees the one who sent me.  &lt;sup&gt;46&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;strong&gt;I have come as a light into the world, so that everyone who believes in me should not remain in darkness&lt;/strong&gt;.  &lt;sup&gt;47&lt;/sup&gt; If anyone hears my words and does not obey them, I do not judge him. For I have not come to judge the world, but to save the world.  &lt;sup&gt;48&lt;/sup&gt; The one who rejects me and does not accept my words has a judge; &lt;strong&gt;the word I have spoken will judge him at the last day&lt;/strong&gt;.  &lt;sup&gt;49&lt;/sup&gt; For I have not spoken from my own authority, but the Father himself who sent me has commanded me what I should say and what I should speak.  &lt;sup&gt;50&lt;/sup&gt; And I know that &lt;strong&gt;his commandment is eternal life&lt;/strong&gt;. Thus the things I say, I say just as the Father has told me.&quot;  
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (John 12:1-50)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Then Mary took three quarters of a pound of expensive aromatic oil from pure nard and anointed the feet of Jesus. She then wiped his feet dry with her hair&lt;/strong&gt;.  &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (John 12:3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three quarters of a pound of costly aromatic oil is undeniably expensive. However, Mary chose to use it on Jesus’ feet. Typically, we would praise Mary for her devotion to Jesus, much like how we highlight the prodigal son’s attitude upon returning home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a different perspective on situations like this. There must be something about Jesus, or the father of the prodigal son, that evoked such an outpouring of love towards the object of their affection. Therefore, I’ve borrowed the title of an old hymn for this section. The refrain of the hymn encapsulates it perfectly: “Amazing love! How can it be that Thou, my God, should die for me!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not merely about us loving God, but rather, how can we not respond in kind to such extraordinary love. John articulates it beautifully: &lt;em&gt;“In this is love: not that we have loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son to be the atoning sacrifice for our sins”&lt;/em&gt; (1 John 4:10).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;in-hindsight&quot;&gt;IN HINDSIGHT&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(159, 29, 33);&quot;&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;His disciples did not understand these things when they first happened, but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written about him and that these things had happened to him&lt;/strong&gt;.)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (John 12:16)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We often make the assumption that both Jesus’ disciples and those who interacted with Him comprehended every word He spoke. However, this is not accurate. Verse 16 indicates that it was only in hindsight that they recalled what Jesus had told them. This is especially true for deeper theological truths, which could only be fully understood after God entrusted Paul with the task of explaining them in his epistles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;love-not-the-world&quot;&gt;LOVE NOT THE WORLD&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(159, 29, 33);&quot;&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; Jesus replied, “&lt;strong&gt;The time has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.  &lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt; I tell you the solemn truth, unless a kernel of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it remains by itself alone. But if it dies, it produces much grain.  &lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt; The one who loves his life destroys it, and the one who hates his life in this world guards it for eternal life.  &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt; If anyone wants to serve me, he must follow me, and where I am, my servant will be too. If anyone serves me, the Father will honor him&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (John 12:23-26)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When discussing the analogy of the &lt;em&gt;“kernel of wheat falling into the ground and dying,&lt;/em&gt;” Jesus is referring to His own impending death. Does this serve as a call for believers to emulate Him? Some belief systems also emphasize the value of self-denial among their followers. Many Christians similarly express this concept of self-denial through various practices such as sacrifice, leading a life of simplicity, adhering to specific disciplines, and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The precious gift of dying to oneself, which the world often seeks, is actually granted to us through Christ, as stated in Galatians 2:20: &lt;em&gt;“I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me.&lt;/em&gt;” This same truth is echoed in Romans 6:6: &lt;em&gt;“We know that our old self was crucified with him so that the body of sin might be brought to nothing, so that we would no longer be enslaved to sin.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, it’s important to understand that no form of self-denial or discipline can lead to the experience of dying to oneself. This profound transformation can only be attained through faith, as described in the verses from Romans and Galatians, where we receive the gift of dying with Christ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without the guidance of Romans and Galatians, how can we grasp the full meaning of what Jesus conveyed in His teachings? Numerous bible teachers endeavor to incorporate the notion of self-denial into their teachings without consulting Paul’s epistles, often resulting in teachings that closely resemble those of various other world religions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-judgement&quot;&gt;THE JUDGEMENT&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(159, 29, 33);&quot;&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt; Jesus said, “&lt;strong&gt;This voice has not come for my benefit but for yours.  &lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt; Now is the judgment of this world; now the ruler of this world will be driven out.  &lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt; And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself&lt;/strong&gt;.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (John 12:30-32)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The term &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“ruler of this world”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; undoubtedly refers to Satan, who has held dominion over the world since humanity’s departure from Eden. However, we also understand that the devil will continue to exercise control over the world until the return of Christ. So, how can Jesus declare that he will now be cast out?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, he will be expelled from the realm of God’s kingdom, where individuals who have responded to Christ’s call are now indwelled by the Holy Spirit. They are akin to a house with a new Master—God (Matthew 12:43-45).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This marks only the commencement of the judgment upon the prince of this world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;walk-in-the-light&quot;&gt;WALK IN THE LIGHT&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(159, 29, 33);&quot;&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;35&lt;/sup&gt; Jesus replied, “&lt;strong&gt;The light is with you for a little while longer. Walk while you have the light, so that the darkness may not overtake you. The one who walks in the darkness does not know where he is going.  &lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt; While you have the light, believe in the light, so that you may become sons of light&lt;/strong&gt;.” When Jesus had said these things, he went away and hid himself from them.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (John 12:35-36)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an earlier section of chapter 9, Jesus states, &lt;em&gt;“As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world,”&lt;/em&gt; while subtly implying that His time in the world is limited. Nevertheless, He also assures us that once He departs, another will take His place—the Holy Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary concept here revolves around walking in the light. Yet, now that Jesus has returned to sit at the right hand of God’s throne, our walk is characterized by the influence of the Holy Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, for many of us, the notion of walking in the Spirit is often viewed through a highly subjective lens. We tend to associate it with activities that we consider overtly spiritual, and pastimes such as bowling or tennis might not be seen as instances of walking in the Spirit. However, this limited perspective doesn’t offer a complete understanding of what it means to be in the Spirit. It is fundamentally tied to our status as children of God, our faith in Christ Jesus, and the sealing of the Holy Spirit—a guarantee from God ensuring our place in His kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, there is one more indicator that can help us discern whether we are truly walking in the Spirit:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law. (Galatians 5:18)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;blinded-and-hardened&quot;&gt;BLINDED AND HARDENED&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(159, 29, 33);&quot;&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;37&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Although Jesus had performed so many miraculous signs before them, they still refused to believe in him&lt;/strong&gt;,  &lt;sup&gt;38&lt;/sup&gt; so that the word of Isaiah the prophet would be fulfilled. He said, “Lord, who has believed our message, and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?”  &lt;sup&gt;39&lt;/sup&gt; For this reason they could not believe, because again Isaiah said,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;strong&gt;“He has blinded their eyes &lt;br /&gt;and hardened their heart, &lt;br /&gt;so that they would not see with their eyes &lt;br /&gt;and understand with their heart, &lt;br /&gt;and turn to me, and I would heal them.”&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;sup&gt;41&lt;/sup&gt; Isaiah said these things because he saw Christ’s glory, and spoke about him.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (John 12:37-41)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many individuals remain veiled from the truth due to their long-held beliefs. In the parable of the wineskins, Jesus conveyed a similar sentiment when He said, &lt;em&gt;“No one after drinking old wine wants the new, for he says, ‘The old is good enough’&lt;/em&gt;” (Luke 5:39).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what symbolizes the “old wine” for the Jews in Jesus’ time? It represents the Old Covenant with its laws and commandments, which they hoped would provide them access to God. The Gospel of John commences with a comparison between Jesus and Moses, signifying the new and the old:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“For the law was given through Moses, but grace and truth came about through Jesus Christ” (John 1:17).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This notion was further reinforced by the Jews when, after a man born blind was healed by Jesus, they derided him and asserted, &lt;em&gt;“You are his disciple! We are disciples of Moses!”&lt;/em&gt; (John 9:28).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From this, we can infer that their reliance on the law to attain God’s righteousness blinded them to accepting Jesus as their Savior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;praise-from-men&quot;&gt;PRAISE FROM MEN&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(159, 29, 33);&quot;&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;42&lt;/sup&gt; Nevertheless, even among the rulers many believed in him, but because of the Pharisees they would not confess Jesus to be the Christ, &lt;strong&gt;so that they would not be put out of the synagogue.  &lt;sup&gt;43&lt;/sup&gt; For they loved praise from men more than praise from God&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (John 12:42-43)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We often place significant importance on an individual’s capacity or willingness to publicly declare their allegiance to Christ, considering it a mark of honor or evidence of their salvation. Nevertheless, it’s crucial to recognize that not all public proclamations, or the absence thereof, arise from the same circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verse 43 highlights that some individuals refrain from openly acknowledging Christ because &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“they loved praise from men more than praise from God.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Conversely, there are others who might be hesitant to profess their faith due to severe consequences that could jeopardize their safety or the well-being of themselves and their loved ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;believe--in-the-light&quot;&gt;BELIEVE = IN THE LIGHT&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(159, 29, 33);&quot;&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;46&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;strong&gt;I have come as a light into the world, so that everyone who believes in me should not remain in darkness&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (John 12:46)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This verse straightforwardly states that being in the light equates to having faith in Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;his-commandment-is-eternal-life&quot;&gt;HIS COMMANDMENT IS ETERNAL LIFE&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(159, 29, 33);&quot;&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;50&lt;/sup&gt; And I know that &lt;strong&gt;his commandment is eternal life&lt;/strong&gt;. Thus the things I say, I say just as the Father has told me.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (John 12:50)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certainly, God’s commandment can lead to eternal life, but only when applied correctly. It’s akin to the most potent medicine that can be lethal if used improperly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God has provided us with commandments under both the Old Covenant and the New Covenant. It is crucial to understand how to apply these remedies to our sin-afflicted souls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Old Covenant commandments, which encompass the Ten Commandments, the extensive Mosaic laws (totaling over 600), along with numerous Pharisaical regulations, and potentially all laws devised by humans since acquiring the knowledge of good and evil, serve the purpose of revealing humanity’s profound depravity and directing them to their Savior, Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The New Covenant commandment is straightforward and repeatedly emphasized throughout the New Testament, as stated in verse 46 of this chapter: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I have come as a light into the world, so that everyone who believes in me should not remain in darkness”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (John 12:46).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if you desire to obey God’s commandment and carry out His work, here is what you must do:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt;So then they said to him, “&lt;strong&gt;What must we do&lt;/strong&gt; to accomplish the deeds God requires?”  &lt;sup&gt;29&lt;/sup&gt;Jesus replied, “This is the deed God requires - to &lt;strong&gt;believe&lt;/strong&gt; in the one whom he sent.” (John 6:28-29)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
