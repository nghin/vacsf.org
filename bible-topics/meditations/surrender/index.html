A quick survey on the Internet with a search engine query: "The Art of Surrender" reveals an overwhelming amount of material on the subject from mostly non-Christian sources. This article uses the same search term in its meta description to see how well it will do in terms of search engine ranking. Which ones among myriad sources might provide the seekers with something that works? I was one such seeker as early as the teen years when adulthood was fast approaching with pensive thoughts of what the future might hold. For a while during this time that I tried yoga with the hope of finding some rest to my soul, the rest that required a degree of surrender.

    <p>Then came Trancendental Meditation, then another year-long study of the Bhagavad Gita, followed with passionate peering through Hermann Hesse’s Siddhartha earnestly looking for a breakthrough out of the endless cycles of birth and death. It was a longing for a surrender, an ability to make peace with one’s existence. No such luck. Just like Siddhartha who would wake up from a period of meditation to find himself still caught in the cycle with no end in sight.</p>

    <h2 id="paul-to-the-galatians">Paul to the Galatians</h2>

    <p>Paul declared a statement of fact concerning the reality of our fleshly existence:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would (Galatians 5:17).</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>If the flesh desires not the things of God, it would not surrender to God. It simply won’t. It’s an innate impossibility. It runs in the veins of the descendants of Eve.</p>

    <p>There is no doubt virtually all Christians long to surrender to God so they may experience the rest that Jesus promised to those who come to Him (Matthew 11:28), but they just simply can’t. The apostle Paul empathizes with us in our struggle to surrender—struggle to surrender? What a contradiction! Like an insomniac trying to lull himself to sleep.</p>

    <p>Paul wrote this as a statement of fact which will be further reinforced when we next study the following Romans passage. In the surrounding context of these passages, the apostle Paul does show us how to surrender, but we soon shall see that the focus of Paul’s writing is not on the act of surrendering, but on a paradigm shift, a transformation by the renewing of one’s mind, from flesh based thinking to that of the spirit.</p>

    <h2 id="paul-to-the-romans">Paul to the Romans</h2>

    <blockquote>
      <p><sup>15</sup>I do not understand what I do. For what I want to do I do not do, but what I hate I do … <sup>21</sup>So I find this law at work: Although I want to do good, evil is right there with me. <sup>22</sup>For in my inner being I delight in God’s law; <sup>23</sup>but I see another law at work in me, waging war against the law of my mind and making me a prisoner of the law of sin at work within me. <sup>24</sup>What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body that is subject to death? <sup>25</sup><u>Thanks be to God, who delivers me through Jesus Christ our Lord!</u> <br /><u>So then, I myself in my mind am a slave to God’s law, but in my sinful nature a slave to the law of sin</u> (Romans 7:15,21-25).</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>There is no mistake in understanding here that the apostle Paul demonstrates the reality of the struggle he faces between his flesh and spirit, between the spirit’s desire to do good and the flesh’s tendency to do evil.</p>

    <p>Verse 25 may be the key reason most Bible expositors missed an important theological point and form a whole school of thought that wrecks havoc in the lives of believers. This verse appears to provide a solution to the flesh vs. spirit struggle as it follows a rather lengthy discourse on the epic battle. It says: <em>“Thanks be to God, who delivers me through Jesus Christ our Lord!”</em> It appears to say that the battle had been won thanks to Christ, now I can conquer my sinful tendency.</p>

    <p>But if we read further to the second half of verse 25 we’d find that it took an entirely different meaning. It starts with “So then, …” which indicates that whatever follows is the conclusion from the facts preceding it. Do you follow the flow of thoughts presented by Paul here? Whatever that you read before the second half of verse 25 leads to the reality that our sin nature is alive and well.</p>

    <p>Let’s read verse 25 from a few translations for better clarity.</p>

    <p class="blockquote">
&rarr; So then, I myself in my mind am a slave to God's law, but in my sinful nature a slave to the law of sin (NIV).<br />
&rarr; So you see how it is: In my mind I really want to obey God's law, but because of my sinful nature I am a slave to sin (NLT&mdash;New Living Translation).<br />
&rarr; So then, on the one hand I myself with my mind am serving the law of God, but on the other, with my flesh the law of sin (NASB).<br />
&rarr; So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin (KJV)<br />
&rarr; So then, I myself serve the law of God with my mind, but with my flesh I serve the law of sin (NET)
</p>

    <p>Paul shows us that we are a composite of two parts, one of the spirit, or mind, and one of flesh, both functioning at the same time for as long as we are still physically alive. Since the spirit part <em>“really want to obey God’s law (NLT),”</em> we find that virtually all Christian liturature and communications focus on the flesh, either trying to stop it from slaving under the law of sin, or trying to make it serve God’s law. Such a global exercise in futility. Didn’t they read from the Bible that <em>“because of my sinful nature I am a slave to sin”</em>?</p>

    <h2 id="to-put-jesus-in-control">To put Jesus in control?</h2>

    <p>We can put this question another way: Can you surrender to God? Here the old hymn “Fully Surrender” came to mind with the following lyrics:</p>

    <p class="blockquote">
Fully surrendered—Lord, I would be,<br />
Fully surrendered, dear Lord, to Thee.<br />
All on the altar laid,<br />
Surrender fully made,<br />
Thou hast my ransom paid;<br />
I yield to Thee.
</p>

    <p>The hymn’s author claims that he can do what the apostle Paul said was impossible. According to Paul the only part that can surrender is the spirit which already serves and obeys the law of God, therefore any attempt to tame the flesh which is a slave to sin would lead to frustration and ultimately a doubt of one’s own salvation. Isn’t this why so many in churches cannot give a positive answer to the question of the assurance of their salvation, and demonstrate a walk with God that is less than victorious?</p>

    <p>Of course we know the reason why. The noble call to surrender to God, to put Jesus in control of one’s life, is pervasive in Christian liturature and communications to the point it takes precedence over the truth set forth in Romans 7:25 which virtually represents the entire book of Romans and all of Paul’s epistles. This sets them up for constant failure because it is clear from verse 25 that <em>“So then, … with my flesh I serve the law of sin.”</em> Do you see the dilemma the Christian is in?</p>

    <h2 id="walk-in-the-spirit">Walk in the Spirit</h2>

    <p>It stands to reason then the focus of ministries should NOT be on the taming of the uncontrollable flesh, but on the walking with the Spirit. To take one’s eyes off of himself but fix on the Savior. To leave morbid introspection but to face outward toward the Son so we may be transformed from glory to glory. Why should we embark on an endeavor knowing we will fail? Should a king go to war with another while knowing he does not have what it takes to win it? (Luke 14:31).</p>

    <p>This is exactly what the apostle Paul suggests as an alternative to taming the flesh: to walk according to the Spirit.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><sup>1</sup><u>Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus</u>, <sup>2</sup>because through Christ Jesus the law of the Spirit who gives life has set you free from the law of sin and death. <sup>3</sup>For what the law was powerless to do because it was weakened by the flesh, God did by sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh to be a sin offering. And so he condemned sin in the flesh, <sup>4</sup>in order that <u>the righteous requirement of the law might be fully met in us</u>, who <u>do not live according to the flesh but according to the Spirit</u> (Romans 8:1-4).</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Let’s pause for a moment to make sure we understand the meaning of walking according to the spirit so that we may be able to do what it says. Keep in mind that Paul never meant for us to slay the self, to surrender, or to cede control to Jesus—such concept may be found in Eastern philosophy or religions but not in the Bible—; what he said in the second part of verse 25 is once again a statement of fact that the flesh is under a different master: the law of sin. He meant to leave it alone until the day Christ comes again when it will be shed like an old wineskin, or an old piece of garment.</p>

    <p>Notice the very beginning of chapter 8, right after Paul presented to us our duality: flesh and spirit, he declared that there is now <em>“no condemnation”</em> to us who believe in Christ. What leads to this declaration, that we can no longer be condemned? Not condemned even when still possessing the flesh that is a slave to the law of sin? Do you see where Paul’s argument is leading?</p>

    <p>We got a “So then, …” followed by a “Therefore …”. So then we’re made up of two parts, flesh and spirit, therefore we’re justified.</p>

    <p>Through Christ, <em>“the law of the Spirit of life”</em> gives us the freedom from judgement demanded by the <em>“law of sin and death.”</em> There are two laws here, which one do you live by? Which law do you live according to? Here if we skip down to Romans 8:4 we’d see a much clearer meaning of “live according to.” We are people who live according to the law of the Spirit of life, not the old law of sin and death which governs the flesh with judgement.</p>

    <p>Hopefully it has become much clearer now the meaning of “live according to the flesh.” It does not mean at all the tendency to fall into sins and temptations, but it means the system of using the flesh, what it does or does not, as a basis of judgement in our relationship with God. The freedom from such dependency is what God has given us through Christ.</p>

    <p>And what does the law of the Spirit of life say?</p>

    <p>First of all, the Holy Spirit clarifies the true meaning of sin. Here’s what Jesus said about Him:</p>

    <p class="blockquote"><sup>8</sup>And when he comes, he will prove the world wrong concerning sin and righteousness and judgment – <sup>9</sup><u>concerning sin, because they do not believe in me</u>; (John 16:8-9)</p>

    <p>From the mouth of God, sin is unbelief in Jesus, therefore eternal life consequently springs from belief in Him. Jesus said of this new law earlier in John: <em>“I am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in me will live, even though they die (John 11:25)”</em></p>

    <p>That is the law of the Spirit of life. The law that is repeated ad nauseam in the New Testament. Which law you choose to live by determines your walk, whether by the flesh, or by the Spirit.</p>

    <h2 id="learn-from-the-foolish-galatians">Learn from the “foolish” Galatians</h2>

    <blockquote>
      <p><sup>1</sup>You foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you? Before your very eyes Jesus Christ was clearly portrayed as crucified. <sup>2</sup>I would like to learn just one thing from you: Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law, or by believing what you heard? <sup>3</sup>Are you so foolish? <u>After beginning by means of the Spirit, are you now trying to finish by means of the flesh</u>? <sup>4</sup>Have you experiencedb so much in vain—if it really was in vain? <sup>5</sup>So again I ask, does God give you his Spirit and work miracles among you by the works of the law, or by your believing what you heard? <sup>6</sup>So also Abraham “believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.” (Galatians 3:1-6)</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The Galatians, just the same as many of us Christians today, started their walk with God by means of the Spirit, which means they relied on nothing except believing in the Savior, now they tried to walk the rest of the way according to the flesh. Isn’t it obvious here they were not using their flesh for sinful indulgences but for seemingly noble spiritual purposes? The walk according to the flesh is exactly the same thing as reliance on the works of the law, because the law ministers to nothing other than the flesh.</p>

    <h2 id="the-ultimate-surrender">The ultimate surrender</h2>

    <p>The true surrender comes as a product of something infinitely more important which precedes it: it is the choosing to walk by the Spirit, by the law of the Spirit of life, and by accepting the liberation from the law of sin and death through Christ Jesus our Lord. The unhealthy focus on surrender creates a vicious cycle that turns the believers’ minds and hearts toward self with disastrous consequences. Jesus wants us to fix our eyes on Him like the Hebrews must fix their eyes on the bronze snake in the desert (John 3:14). You can no more put Jesus in control than the one who walks by the flesh can serve the law of God. Choose instead to walk by the Spirit and you will know Jesus’ promised rest which includes the elusive ability to surrender, or to put Jesus in control of your life. It will be added unto you without trying.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>So I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh (Galatians 5:16)</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Paul didn’t say: Be vigilant and resist all temptations and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh. He askes us to walk by the Spirit. When the Hebrews got bitten by snakes in the desert, Moses didn’t provide training on how to prevent snake bites, but instead he hung a bronze snake by God’s instruction so that those who look upon it would be saved. So it is with the art of surrender, with trying to put Jesus in control, with myriad things pertaining to godliness, walk by the Spirit by simply fixing your eyes on Jesus. All it takes is faith as little as a mustard seed.</p>
