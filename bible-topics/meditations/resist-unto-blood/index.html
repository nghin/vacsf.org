The gospel sounds very attractive especially for those who have embarked on a treadmill of religion with no hope of salvation in sight. They heard of Jesus' promise of water that satisfies forever, of rest for the weary, of peace that passes understanding, and how He died on the cross one time for all the sins of mankind, they thought there in this wonderful religion is their hope. But once they got into the fold, after an initial honeymoon of joy unspeakable, somehow they found themselves back on the treadmill. They're confused but couldn't quite put their fingers on what is going on. The messages they heard from pulpits for decades seemed different from what they heard when they were still in the dark. They used to hear of the forgiveness of sins, now they keep hearing stern warning of sins that they must "resist unto blood." It seemed to them the Christians haven't solved their sin problem.
</p>

</div>
    <!-- ##################### PLACEHOLDER ###################-->

    <p>More than once during these years they’ve heard messages from Hebrews 12:1-4 which left them an impression that their troubles are far from over. Memories of that first love when they knelt at the cross are all but fading. Maybe those weren’t real at all. Though the number of times they heard sermons on this passage are few, they still served to magnify the giants in the promised land, to grow the seed of doubt and fear concerning their eternal destiny.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><sup>1</sup>Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses, <u>we must get rid of every weight and the sin that clings so closely</u>, and run with endurance the race set out for us,  <sup>2</sup>keeping our eyes fixed on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of our faith. For the joy set out for him he endured the cross, disregarding its shame, and has taken his seat at the right hand of the throne of God. <sup>3</sup>Think of him who endured such opposition against himself by sinners, so that you may not grow weary in your souls and give up.  <sup>4</sup><u>You have not yet resisted to the point of bloodshed in your struggle against sin</u> (Hebrews 12:2-4).</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h2 id="common-interpretation">Common interpretation</h2>

    <p>The underlined parts of these verses appear to confirm the common interpretation that we must make every effort to banish sins from our lives in order to run the race that is laid out before us. It makes sense, doesn’t it? It makes a lot of sense that a race runner must eliminate anything that can potentially affect his performance. Therefore in a Christian race, sin is a major obstacle that must be dealt with in every aspect.</p>

    <p>If this is truly the meaning that the Hebrews’ author had in mind, what would be the implication in Christian living? What message is conveyed to the unbelieving world? What hope is there for Christian? How does it affect one’s relationship with God?</p>

    <h2 id="self-centered-morbid-introspection">Self-centered morbid introspection</h2>

    <p>How does a Christian comply with this exhortation to get rid of every hindrances, resist every sin even to the point that their own blood must be shed?</p>

    <p>The implication is the Christian must be vigilant at all times, must monitor every thought, must be conscious of every action. Let us assume that this Christian has such a capacity to do so, to be always on the alert, how long can he sustain such a level of intensity?</p>

    <p>Doesn’t it sound tiring? Doesn’t it sound anything but rest and an easy yoke? No, such a lifestyle, or a mindset, is not normal if not cultic, bordering on mind control, and drawing our own thoughts toward ourselves instead of lifting up toward Christ. The idea is noble but the end result is self-centeredness.</p>

    <p>But does the major bulk of Scriptures advocate such a pattern for living? Might we have misunderstood the writer’s intention?</p>

    <h2 id="can-you-get-rid-of-every-weight-and-sin">Can you get rid of every weight, and sin?</h2>

    <p>Again assuming one is able to sustain a high level of focus and dedication to watch every thought and action, can one actually get rid of every weight and every sin?</p>

    <p>Imagine a tightrope walker. Imagine the rope is so long it takes the walker his whole lifetime to walk its whole length. Every stumble can be deadly, and can make the next step a more formidable one to take. A sin is like one such stumble. Would you say such walk is a fulfilling of Jesus’ promise: <em>“Come to Me, all who are weary and heavy-laden, and I will give you rest”</em>? Or <em>“I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to Me will never hunger, and whoever believes in Me will never thirst”</em>?</p>

    <h2 id="what-was-christ-resisting">What was Christ resisting?</h2>

    <p>Let us go back to the passage to take another look at the context surrounding Hebrews 12:4. From verses 2 through 3 we started out with the call to fix our eyes on Jesus, the beginning and the completion of our faith. What did he have to endure? His own sins? Did he resist unto blood for his own sins?</p>

    <p>The sins in the context of these verses that Christ had to endure are not his own, but those of others, of all of mankind, and what he had to resist were not temptations, but against oppositions to his salvation plan. It is to these oppositions that he had to shed blood. It’s not just that the cause for Jesus’ suffering is different than ours, He is the only One worthy to be God’s unblemished Lamb to become a once-for-all sacrifice for us.</p>

    <p>Under the Old Covenant, the animals shed blood as a remedy for sins, but only for a limited time and then must be repeated again. They didn’t shed blood for their own sins, or for characters to be built into them, but they did as a foreshadow of the final shedding of blood of the Lamb of God. Christ shed blood to end all other shedding of blood.</p>

    <p>What are you supposed to be shedding your blood for? Nothing. It would have served no purpose except your own; not dissimilar to offering strange fire (Leviticus 10:1) or self-appointed priesthood (Numbers 16).</p>

    <p>In our house, when our kids are picky about the food we feed them, we like to tell them about kids in some other places of the world who’d love to have what they’re taking for granted; you guys haven’t had to work a day of your lives, you haven’t had to go to sleep worrying about whether you would have food tomorrow. Perhaps it’s here Paul should write: <em>“I’m speaking in human terms because of the weakness of your flesh (Romans 6:19).”</em></p>

    <h2 id="the-real-weight-and-sin">The real weight and sin</h2>

    <p>Perhaps the subtltle in this section could be <strong>“What gets rid of the weight and sin,”</strong> but there isn’t enough room to hold both titles.</p>

    <p>The real weight and the sin that easily entangles cannot be common trespasses among men, because even if someone manages to never fall into any temptation, sin is everpresent in his life (Romans 5:14).</p>

    <p>The real weight in a believer’s life are not the bad things that they do, because in their flesh they’re slaves to the law of sin, which means they cannot stop sinning (Romans 7:25), but it is the weight of guilt that bog them down.</p>

    <p>And the real sin again are not trespasses that all sinners commit, but the sin of unbelief (John 16:9). Because though they may manage to never commit any sins common to man, they’re sinners nonetheless.</p>

    <p>It stands to reason then that the only way to get rid of every weight and the sin that easily entangles is faith in Christ, to always walk in the firm belief that Christ’s sacrifice on the cross is more than sufficient to save them, to always rest in the finished work of Christ.</p>

    <h2 id="fix-your-eyes-on-christ">Fix your eyes on Christ</h2>

    <p>Nothing can help us get rid of all the weight and the sin that easily entangles, not even when somehow someone possesses the ability to withstand all temptations, nothing except one: Christ’s substitutionary death on the cross and our faith in such sacrifice.</p>

    <p>This is exactly what the apostle wrote in verse 2: <em>“keeping our eyes fixed on Jesus.”</em> That is the only way that works, the only way that can get rid of all the weight and the sin that easily entangles.</p>

    <p>And the part about Christ’s resisting unto blood, it is clear from the context of the passage that what Christ had to endure was his journey to the cross to save mankind which includes the shedding of his precious blood. He shed blood so we didn’t have to. The battle against sin had been won by Christ, ours is simply to keep our eyes on Him, and walk the remainder of our days by faith.</p>

    <p>Christianity is not like the rest of the religions of the world who like to play the game of Whac-A-Mole. At least it’s not supposed to be. But in reality this game is widely played within the Christian faith, and they’re doing the exact opposite of what Paul tells them to do.</p>
