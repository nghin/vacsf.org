<p>This is the first baptism at our new church building on Vermont Street, San Francisco. During the renovation of this church, the men, as well as many others who contributed in different manners especially in the provision of food during the work hours, had a great time working together. The baptistry used in this event was one such project which provided a great opportunity for fellowship.</p>
<p>These are some photos taken during this baptism ceremony. Enjoy.</p>
