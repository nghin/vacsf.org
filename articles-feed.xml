    &lt;p&gt;What seems to preoccupy most Christians is the issue of sin, both of the things you should do but don’t do, and of the things you should not do but you do. The same thing is also true with the majority of Christian teaching which is dedicated toward solving this perennial problem. But the key verse we’re studying in this article denounces it as elementary teaching while it admonishes us to move on to maturity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;repentance&quot;&gt;Repentance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://vacsf.org/assets/images/repentance-from-dead-works-teaser.jpg&quot; style=&quot;border: 1px solid #cccccc; margin: 7px 15px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 148px; padding: 0px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;
The irony is it is the very issue of sins that drives people to Jesus, but it still plagues them years after they came to Christ. In their mind, they believe their sins are forgiven once and for all when they placed their trust in Christ, and through that faith they have eternal life, access to God through prayer, and many other fundamental beliefs. However, there seems to be a great disparity between what they believe in theory—the church’s doctrine that they hold—, and how they live out these beliefs in real life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quick survey on the internet shows the following definition of repentance:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“What is repentance? Is it just a single decision that leads to baptism? No, it also must be an ongoing frame of mind, recognizing that &lt;strong&gt;overcoming sin is a lifetime effort&lt;/strong&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overcoming sin is a lifetime effort. My decades of sermon listening both in church and on the radio, and book reading shows the statement above is quite accurate of the approach most Christians take in their walk with God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So out of the desire to be more thorough in laying the groundwork for this article, I continued to survey the internet for more opinions on this topic of repentance. The more I searched, the heavier I felt, but the peculiar thing is, in as many exhortations as I found, no one gave a clear answer as to how a Christian can achieve reproducible results in a consistent manner. Let’s consider this quote from J. I. Packer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Repentance means turning from &lt;strong&gt;as much as you know&lt;/strong&gt; of your sin to give &lt;strong&gt;as much as you know&lt;/strong&gt; of yourself to &lt;strong&gt;as much as you know&lt;/strong&gt; of your God, and as our knowledge grows at these three points so our practice of repentance has to be enlarged.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As much as you know? How much is it that I know that can bring me to a state of resolution where there can be rest to my soul? I hurriedly closed all the browser tabs with searches on repentance as the more I searched, the more confused I became. There wasn’t a single thing I could count on that I could do consistently to maintain my peace with God. There is though one silver lining in these internet searches, I was reminded of how far I’ve come since I came to Christ. The heaviness I felt, the great burden on my back much like that which was on Christian’s back in John Bunyan’s Pilgrim’s Progress, was reminiscent of the years before I found peace with God. Such longing for peace, for self acceptance, for life’s meaning. Why are these pillars of faith making people more confused instead of pointing them to a real solution? Or perhaps they do not know it for themselves?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, I wasn’t looking for an answer for myself, but for my readers who are still struggling to find that place of rest. I found this wonderful rest that is written in Hebrews 4:11 and out of exceeding joy I’m now pointing others to it. The path to it doesn’t require any work, nor any repentance as I shall prove later, but it does require one thing: to believe, even with a faith as small as a mustard seed. Now back to our discourse on repentance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are as many views on the meaning of repentance as there are denominations multiplied by the individuals with their own experiences. This article does not aim to prove the correctness or errors of certain views, but it aims to question whether the most commonly accepted view of repentance, with the overcoming of sin as its most dominant objective, in the Christian world view of an average believer, is what God has in mind for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-knowledge-of-good-and-evil&quot;&gt;The knowledge of good and evil&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repentance is not a new concept, as a matter of fact it’s almost as old as time itself when the knowledge of good and evil began to inhabit the hearts of Adam and Eve after they ate of the forbidden fruit, and this was perhaps many millennia before the Ten Commandments were given. This new knowledge began to create inner conflicts in the heart of man with the deafening voice of their conscience constantly either accusing or defending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For whenever the Gentiles, who do not have the law, do by nature the things required by the law, these who do not have the law are a law to themselves. They show that the work of the law is written in their hearts, as their conscience bears witness and their conflicting thoughts accuse or else defend them (Romans 2:14-15).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to the Fall in Eden, there was no need for repentance for man did not possess the knowledge of good and evil. But now with a ruthless judge dwelling in their conscience, surely there must be responses either of denial or tears of repentance or inner conflicts that put them in great turmoil. Then the Lord God reduced the breadth of the conscience-based law into a set of clear standards, the Ten Commandments, so man can more easily measure themselves, so that perhaps they may realize how far they have fallen short of God’s glory and be more willing to place their trust in the Messiah when he comes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-vicious-cycle&quot;&gt;The vicious cycle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So over the ages, man sinned and they repented, and the cycle repeats over and over again, the vicious cycle of sin and repentance. How many thousand more years before they can break free from it? Granted they can offer sacrifices, or verbal confessions, for their sins, but those are only temporary measures until they sin again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The law is only a shadow of the good things that are coming—not the realities themselves. For this reason it can never, by the same sacrifices repeated endlessly year after year, make perfect those who draw near to worship. Otherwise, would they not have stopped being offered? For the worshipers would have been cleansed once for all, and would &lt;strong&gt;no longer have felt guilty&lt;/strong&gt; for their sins. But those sacrifices are an annual reminder of sins. It is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins (Hebrews 10:1-4).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you notice the words in bold face above? It indicates there is an effective remedy to the issue of sin which would once for all cleanse the worshippers and remove their guilty conscience. Here are what that remedy is NOT. It’s not sacrifices of bull and goats. It’s not your confession of sins. It’s not your penances or whatever forms of making amends. It is the body of Christ:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Then he said, “Here I am, I have come to do your will.” He sets aside the first to establish the second. And by that will, we have been made holy through the sacrifice of the &lt;strong&gt;body of Jesus Christ once for all&lt;/strong&gt; (Hebrews 10:9-10).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;breaking-free&quot;&gt;Breaking free&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the repentance God wants. Not the kind of repentance to be repeated over and over again of dead works, or the bad things that we do, but a once-for-all kind of repentance of the ultimate sin of unbelief. This repentance has to do with our trusting that though we will still sin until the day we die, Christ’s death on the cross gives us a once-for-all forgiveness of sins that breaks the cycle to set us free. Dare you believe what Hebrews 10:2 says: &lt;em&gt;“no longer have felt guilty for their sins”&lt;/em&gt;? Is God promoting sins by giving man such freedom from a guilty conscience? No, because elsewhere in Scriptures it is written that a conscience free from guilt actually promotes holy living.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we come to the verse that gives this article its title:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;So let us stop going over the basic teachings about Christ again and again. Let us go on instead and become mature in our understanding. Surely we don’t need to start again with the fundamental importance of repenting from evil deeds and placing our faith in God (Hebrews 6:1—New Living Translation)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doesn’t this sound familiar, if you’re a faithful churchgoer who never missed a Sunday sermon? Of course, I’m exaggerating as who wouldn’t miss a Sunday or two. Repenting from evil deeds and faith in God are the two most common underlying themes no matter what topic is being addressed. Furthermore, the Hebrews author calls them “basic teachings,” or elementary teachings in some other translations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what’s wrong with a good dose of teaching that all Christians must repent from evil deeds? And what’s wrong with teaching that Christians should have faith in God?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;repentance-from-dead-works&quot;&gt;Repentance from dead works&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t make sense that Christians must be reminded ad nauseum that they should repent from dead works, or from sinful actions. Even a child know that, or to take it further, even an unbeliever know that. How do we know that? Let’s quote again the verse shown earlier in the “Knowledge of good and evil” section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For whenever the Gentiles, who do not have the law, do by nature the things required by the law, these who do not have the law are a law to themselves. They show that the work of the law is written in their hearts, as their conscience bears witness and their conflicting thoughts accuse or else defend them (Romans 2:14-15).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The knowledge of good and evil ensures that every descendant of Adam and Eve is capable of repentance, especially repentance from bad deeds to be more specific. Now if an unbeliever, a spiritually dead person, knows intimately the meaning of repentance from evil deeds, shouldn’t a Christian, one who is indwelled by the Third Person of the Godhead, know any less? Wouldn’t the Spirit of God who breathed life into them guide them in the way everlasting?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, the problem Christians have is not that they sin and they love their sins, but &lt;em&gt;“For I do not do the good I want, but I do the very evil I do not want! (Romans 7:19).”&lt;/em&gt; What Paul describes in Romans 7:19 is the common experience of genuine born again believers. They hate the evil things that they do. What Paul said is contrary to the volume of teaching we hear everyday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why all the teaching on this aspect is considered childish, elementary, and basic, by the Hebrews’ author who seems to say: Please, no more basic stuff; there’s no need to keep telling Christians of sins and repentance. They’re wracked with guilt but don’t know how to break free from the cycle of sin and repentance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;have-faith-in-god&quot;&gt;Have faith in God&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though this article’s title does not contain this part of the key verse, it might as well be tackled as part of the “elementary teaching” dismissed by the Hebrews’ author. What that makes a Christian go to church, to turn on the radio tuned to Christian radio, buy a Christian book from a bookstore, is their faith in God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s entirely possible that their faith in God is like a bruised reed or a smoldering wick (Matthew 12:20), they should be built up in a manner different than constant exhortation that they should have faith in God, but the focus should be on the object of their faith, not in faith itself. The more they know the object of their faith, the stronger their faith will be. And we know what it is, the object of their faith, the Lord Jesus Christ and all the wonderful things he’s accomplished for them, from the forgiveness of their sins to the assurance of their salvation to the full righteousness that he bestowed on them as children of God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, focus on the object of their faith, not in faith itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;i-will-be-their-god&quot;&gt;I will be their God&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“For this is the covenant that I will establish with the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord. I will put my laws in their minds and I will inscribe them on their hearts. And &lt;strong&gt;I will be their God and they will be my people&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“And &lt;strong&gt;there will be no need at all for each one to teach his countryman or each one to teach his brother saying, ‘Know the Lord,’ since they will all know me, from the least to the greatest&lt;/strong&gt;.
“For I will be merciful toward their evil deeds, and &lt;strong&gt;their sins I will remember no longer&lt;/strong&gt;.” (Hebrews 8:10-12; Jeremiah 31:33-34)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The elementary teachings keep Christians from maturing in their faith. Instead of fixing their eyes on Christ, they keep the believers fixated on themselves, their sins and the never-ending state of guilt expressed in repentance—of course, I’m not talking about the repentance that brought them to Christ, but about the repentance the average Christians equate with remorse, with feeling sorry for their sinful actions—.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Live in this truth: &lt;em&gt;“their sins I will remember no longer.”&lt;/em&gt; If God had said so, and you believed it, then don’t parade your sins before Him anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Almost all Christians must have heard at least more than once sermons that encourage them to deny themselves, take up their cross, and follow Jesus as both a commandment and a promise that they would experience peace, joy, and ultimately a more fulfilling Christian life. Is this what Jesus had in mind when he spoke these words?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://vacsf.org/assets/images/deny-yourself-teaser.jpg&quot; style=&quot;border: 1px solid #cccccc; margin: 7px 15px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 148px; padding: 0px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;
At first glance, the three aspects of what Jesus spoke in Matthew 16:24 appear to be achievable goals, and Christians set out to achieve these goals with a vengeance. A huge amount of communication is dedicated toward teaching Christians how to achieve a measure of success toward these goals. But is a measure of success good enough? For certainly Jesus was not speaking to those who were already in God’s kingdom, but to the lost world of the requirements for entering it. He is posing an impossible standard that only he could achieve: to deny one’s self, to bear the cross, and to follow in his footstep. This article will show that these are not challenges to see who qualifies for God’s kingdom, but are stern ominous shouts from the One who is going to the cross: “Will you surrender?”. We should not hear it with any less alarm than the terrifying scene around mount Sinai when the law was about to be delivered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article was inspired from a verse that was quoted at the end of an email. This verse, which I had heard sermons on it several times in my decades of sitting in my church pews, over the radio, or through Christian literature that I devoured in my early years as a Christian, became my life’s purpose years before Rick Warren’s Purpose Driven Life was written.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;matthew-1624&quot;&gt;Matthew 16:24&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me (Matthew 16:24)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you hover over this verse Matthew 16:24 and right-click to open it in a new window or tab, you’d find a short commentary on the verse: “Discipleship is costly.” This subtitle is found in the NASB, Amplified, and various other versions. No, discipleship is much more than being costly, it’s priceless. It took God’s only begotten Son to pay for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;self-denial&quot;&gt;Self denial&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To what extent does Jesus ask you to deny yourself? Denying yourself of certain pleasures by restricting certain foods or drinks, or follow the pattern of the Colossians who prescribed “do not handle, do not taste, do not touch” (Colossians 2:21), or other forms of personal sacrifice? No, Hebrews 9:22 says that &lt;em&gt;“without the shedding of blood there can be no forgiveness of sins.”&lt;/em&gt; And it’s not just a spilling of some blood, it’s all of it until death, and that was what Jesus did. He died. The condition for becoming his disciple, for following him, is not just mere denial of something, but a denial unto death through the shedding of your own blood. And even then, when you did shed your own blood, it wouldn’t do you any good because you don’t qualify as an unblemished sacrifice. The Old Covenant requirement for sacrificial beasts is they have to be accepted by the High Priest as unblemished. Jesus is unblemished but you are not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now why am I talking about death when the verse only talks about self denial? Because Jesus spoke these words as a condition for salvation, not discipleship. The New Covenant was not yet made available until Christ denied himself by enduring the cross. He was asking his listener though they did not know what he was alluding to: can you endure what I’m about to endure? But of course, this is just a rhetorical question, because your death on the cross will not yield the righteousness you need for an entrance into God’s kingdom, as I had alluded to earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is another aspect of self that no sinner can deny. It’s their Adamic nature. No matter what amount of obedience or lawkeeping can rid them off the part of them that the apostle Paul referred to as he cried: &lt;em&gt;“Wretched man that I am! Who will rescue me from this &lt;strong&gt;body of death&lt;/strong&gt;?”&lt;/em&gt; It’s the part that became ours when Adam and Eve lost eternal life in the garden of Eden. Self denial is a pipe dream, but it became a reality for us when we came to trust in Christ who died on our behalf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For you have died and your life is hidden with Christ in God (Colossians 3:3).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is how you deny yourself, by the grace of God and by your faith in the One who God had sent to die for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;take-up-your-cross&quot;&gt;Take up your cross&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is just a continuation of the denial of self explained above. The cross requires the one who carries it to end up at the point of death. It’s not at all the kind of cross people generally think of, the cross of life’s struggles, or of trials and tribulations. It’s the cross to pay for someone’s sin, and, as discussed earlier in the self denial section, no one is qualified to endure such cross except Jesus Christ. In short, can you endure a cross to the point of death?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;following-jesus&quot;&gt;Following Jesus&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again, Jesus does not simply call men to become his disciples, but he calls them first to become children of God, citizens of his kingdom, to pass from death to life, or to put it simply to be saved. While he spoke Matthews 16:24, He was still preparing the world to receive his free gift of life through his death on the cross. Jesus was using the language of the world when he called them to follow him. Adherents of other religions follow their leaders while Christians enjoy the fellowship with Jesus making his abode in their hearts. He no longer calls those who trust in him servants, but friends and children of God. The work that we do as citizens of God’s kingdom is just a byproduct, an inevitable consequence of us being attached to the Vine, having the full right to become children of God, and sealed by his Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-new-and-living-way&quot;&gt;A new and living way&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This verse Matthew 16:24 is not the basis of the new ministry of reconciliation, but the old ministry of condemnation. It should give any Christian a shudder had God not given us a new way to draw near to him through his Son. We’d find bodies of Christians strewn about as each attempts to obey its impossible command to make peace with God. Ah, but here’s the irony, had they tried to crucify themselves, to chop off their hands and feet, to pluck out their eyes, to sell all their possessions to give to the poor, they would have quickly discovered the futility of such attempts as they still wouldn’t know to what extent they must go to meet God’s righteous requirements. But thankfully:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Therefore, brothers, since we have confidence to enter the Most Holy Place by the blood of Jesus, by a &lt;strong&gt;new and living way&lt;/strong&gt; opened for us through the curtain, that is, &lt;strong&gt;his body&lt;/strong&gt; (Hebrews 10:19-20)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s his body, not ours. Go in peace.&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary type="text">Almost all Christians must have heard at least more than once sermons that encourage them to deny themselves, take up their cross, and follow Jesus as both a commandment and a promise that they would experience peace, joy, and ultimately a more fulfilling Christian life. Is this what Jesus had in mind when he spoke these words?</summary>

Having been buried with him in baptism, you also have been raised with him through your faith in the power of God who raised him from the dead (Colossians 2:11-12—NET).”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://vacsf.org/assets/images/putting-off-of-the-body-of-the-flesh-teaser.jpg&quot; style=&quot;border: 1px solid #cccccc; margin: 7px 15px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 148px; padding: 0px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;
An article of a similar topic was written previously under the title &lt;a href=&quot;http://vacsf.org/articles/Mortify-the-Deeds-of-the-Flesh/&quot;&gt;“Mortify The Deeds Of The Flesh.”&lt;/a&gt; This article is not a rewrite, but another look at it from a different angle based on a different verse. It is inspired from a sermon I heard at a Summer camp based on Colossians 2:11-12. During the sermon, the speaker refered to R. C. Sproul’s Coram Deo on the same verse. Interestingly, as I queried the world wide web to take the pulse of the general population in how they interpret these verses, R. C. Sproul’s Coram Deo on Colossians 2:11-12 showed up as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Our old Adamic nature has been mortally wounded, but it refuses to stay buried. Having a new nature in Christ, we must put sin to death when it rises up. This means that we must resist temptation and repent when we give in, for we will not be perfect until we are in heaven. Calvin comments on today’s passage that “burial expresses a continued process of mortification.” Sin is powerless to control us, but it is still dangerous and must be resisted.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;(excerpted from original article at: http://www.ligonier.org/learn/devotionals/dead-and-buried-with-christ/).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several key concepts in this Coram Deo of R. C. Sproul need to be checked against foundational truths found in Scriptures, and especially in the immediate context of the verses in question. These concepts are embraced by virtually all in Christianity though they’re unbiblical and can wreck havoc in the life of believers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mortally-wounded&quot;&gt;Mortally wounded&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Coram Deo: Our old Adamic nature has been mortally wounded, but it refuses to stay buried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know that we’re sinners not because of the sinful things that we do, or the good things that we fail to do, but because of what comes from deep inside: our sin nature. Whether or not we commit any of these sins, we’re sinners. Jesus said so himself: &lt;em&gt;“What defiles a person is not what goes into the mouth; it is what comes out of the mouth that defiles a person (Matthew 15:11).”&lt;/em&gt; Then how can it be that our sin nature is “mortally wounded” yet still manages to produce sins? No, our Adamic nature will never be completely dead until we as believers put on the incorruptible (1 Corinthians 15:52-54). Until then, it’s alive and well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, our Adamic nature is only mortally wounded in the sense that its sin no longer has the power to condemn us as we have been released from the law (Romans 7:6).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;put-sin-to-death&quot;&gt;Put sin to death&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Coram Deo continued: Having a new nature in Christ, we must put sin to death when it rises up. This means that we must resist temptation and repent when we give in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no doubt that any transgression causes great pain to both the transgressor and those who are in its path of destruction. With few exceptions, all Christians know the painful consequences of sins, and they know that should, and must, resist temptations. Even unbelievers know and are fearful of what price they have to pay when they fall. They don’t need to go to church to learn what even a child knows, as wisdom cries out in the marketplace (Proverbs 1:20).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about repentance in the context of the Coram Deo? By the time a sin had been committed, repentance would be useless. So is an apology as it would be just lip service. It’s better not to fall into sin at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Lord, however, provides us with a way to deal with sin in the event we fall into temptation. Not repentance, not remorse, not shedding of crocodile tears, not lip service of apology, but an assurance that our citizenship of God’s kingdom will still be in tact:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous (1 John 2:1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because we have Jesus, the Advocate, who sits besides God the Father to plead our case. What do you think is stronger? Our repentance or Jesus’ defense? Even our offering of ourselves to be nailed on a cross for our sins would be no match for the powerful defense of the Attorney-at-Law—as a matter of fact, God will not accept our own crucifixion on the cross as a substitution for our sins as none of us are “unblemished” enough to qualify. This is where God’s way is not our way is exemplified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, if our lifelong goal is to battle sins, we’d be fighting a losing battle, or going about it the wrong way. It’s infinitely better to fix our eyes on Christ than on our enemy the devil. I have a great real-life example to demonstrate this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a Christian sister at our church who works in the service industry. She asked me for an advise on how to deal with someone among her customers who frequently tried to seduce her. My advise to her was to fix her eyes on Jesus, to regularly come to Him to draw from Him strength that comes as a result of an assurance of her salvation, His unconditional love, His total forgiveness of her sins, and many other wonderful gifts that God gave her along with His Son.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now if she chose a different approach, the one suggested by the Coram Deo or common exhortations, she would, throughout the day, even while she is at home, prepare herself to say no to the temptation. She would most likely imagine herself being in the same situation, going through different scenarios, and so on so forth. Do you get the drift of where this is going? She would end up, in her mind, being with the man all day long even while she is at home. Is this the way you prepare yourself to resist temptations?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a child of God live, breath, and rest in their identity as children of God, as they set their minds on things above, they will be more ready to battle sins when they come. But if they are constantly thinking of sins, even thinking of how to resist sins, they will more likely fall when temptations do come, they will be like soldiers who are worn out from sleepless night worrying about their enemies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fix your eyes on Jesus then you will be more able to resist sins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the Israelites were bitten by snakes in the desert, God instructed Moses to hang a bronze snake on a pole so whoever lift up their eyes upon the snake after being bitten would not die. There was no need for Moses to remind folks to try to avoid getting snake bites, or to repent upon getting bitten, but that they just needed to lift up their eyes to behold the bronze snake. The bites are painful and deadly enough as a deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;…  if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous (1 John 2:1).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up: That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life (John 3:14-15).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;perfecting-the-self&quot;&gt;Perfecting the self&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Coram Deo continued: … for we will not be perfect until we are in heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This part of the Coram Deo says that our life’s purpose is to pursue perfection though we will not be able to reach it until we’re heaven. This idea of Christians working toward perfection is unbiblical in several aspects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, Jesus had stated in Matthew 5:48: &lt;em&gt;“Be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect,”&lt;/em&gt; which means if you’re not ALREADY perfect, you will not be ushered into God’s presence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, the apostle Paul also expressed his dismay in Galatians 3:3: &lt;em&gt;“Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh?”&lt;/em&gt; Having begun in the Spirit, having been born again from above, having what it takes to boldly enter the throne of grace, and you’re still trying to get more perfect through your flesh? By battling with your sin? Didn’t Christ already circumcise you? And if He already removed your corrupt nature (verse 11), which part of you is still not perfect? (Keep in mind that though you will still sin until the day you die, you’re perfect in God’s eyes as He sees you through His perfect Son)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, Hebrews 10:14 says this: &lt;em&gt;“For by one sacrifice he has made perfect forever those who are being made holy.”&lt;/em&gt; By one sacrifice, the sacrifice of the Lamb or God, not by the continual resisting or repenting in relation to sin. And if Christ already made you perfect forever then what are you perfecting?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these verses, and many more that can be found in Scriptures, point to the fact that our perfection is not arrived at through our personal effort in dealing with sin, but through what Christ did alone. All our effort in dealing with sins is like trying to deal with pimples while there is a cancerous corrupt nature inside that only Christ could deal with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;continued-process-of-mortification&quot;&gt;Continued process of mortification&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Coram Deo continued: Calvin comments on today’s passage that “burial expresses a continued process of mortification.” Sin is powerless to control us, but it is still dangerous and must be resisted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are we being buried alive? Being buried and continue to die? The Bible doesn’t say this is how we die. It says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Therefore we have been buried with him through baptism into death, in order that just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we too may live a new life (Romans 6:4).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have been buried with Christ. It’s a done deal. Furthermore:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Having been buried with him in baptism, you also have been raised with him through your faith in the power of God who raised him from the dead (Colossians 2:12).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This verse gives further clarification that we were not only buried with Christ, we died with Him, too, as no one can be raised unless he’s already dead. Jesus spoke of this truth in no uncertain terms:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Truly, truly, I tell you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains by itself alone. But if it dies, it bears much fruit (John 12:24).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The being raised back to life is implied here in the &lt;em&gt;“bears much fruit”&lt;/em&gt; part of the verse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These verses show us clearly that the “continued process of mortification” concept is not found at all in the Bible, yet we find it underlying messages virtually throughout Christiandom—or perhaps it is a milder version of purgatory? The Bible passages cited in this writing is, by no means exhaustive but sufficiently representative, to show gross misinterpretations and applications of Colossians 2:11-12 as a case in point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;in-conclusion&quot;&gt;In conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you notice the contrast between Colossians 2:11-12 and the Coram Deo?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Scripture passage conveys a sense of liberation, of triumph, with Christ as the prime mover in accomplishing the great task of taking away our sin nature. But most importantly, a sense of finality, that the work to present us as being ready to enter into the presence of the Most High, to boldly enter the throne of grace, has been accomplished. Christ the Giver, and us the recipients of an undeserved favor. Therefore we keep looking up to Christ the starter and the finisher of our faith.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Coram Deo projects something completely different. It tells us to engage in morbid introspection, to take our eyes off of Christ and focus on ourselves and the enemy of our souls. It tells us to go back to the desert as there are formidable giants in the promised land. It tells us that now is NOT the acceptable time, now is NOT the day of salvation (2 Corinthians 6:2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t believe in the Coram Deo, but believe in Colossians 2:11-12. Take it at its face value. There is now no longer a bronze snake, but there is Christ who sits on the right hand of God to plead your case that you are perfect—despite numerous snake bites. You were buried with Christ and now alive with Him in the newness of life. It’s done. It’s finished.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Before Jesus took his last breath on the cross, he said: &lt;em&gt;“It’s finished.”&lt;/em&gt; So just as God rested after he completed the work of creation, Jesus rested after he completed the work of saving man. It is his will that we enter this rest, yet so many Christians do not experience it, their walk with God is still weighed down with burdens as they try to achieve what only Jesus could achieve for them, and he had already done so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://vacsf.org/assets/images/entering-Gods-rest-teaser.jpg&quot; style=&quot;border: 1px solid #cccccc; margin: 7px 15px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 148px; padding: 0px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;
The burden that man must carry is both physical and spiritual, however, Jesus came to address mainly the later. Physical burden must be born by both believers and unbelievers alike, some enjoy a life of ease while others toil for their survival irrespective of spiritual condition. But when Jesus spoke the following well known verse: &lt;em&gt;“Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest” (Matthew 11:28)&lt;/em&gt;, was he not also talking about the physical burden, or perhaps at least together with the spiritual as well?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it is Jesus’ will to relieve us of our physical burden, such as ill health, financial issues, etc., he would have easily solved them through various physical means. If he could create the universe and everything in it, he could very well restore your good health, and give you resources to fix your financial problems. Jesus didn’t die to provide solutions to man’s physical problems, he died for their sins, and the guilt that weighed them down. Therefore the burden of man that must be lifted is the burden of sin which can only be accomplished by Christ on the cross on our behalf. This burden is uniquely a spiritual one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;religious-burden&quot;&gt;Religious burden&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Woe to you, experts in the law and you Pharisees, hypocrites! You cross land and sea to make one convert, and when you get one, you make him twice as much a child of hell as yourselves!” (Matthew 23:15)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pharisees make people children of hell not in the sense that they teach them to do evil things, or things against the law of God, but religious traditions which in reality drove them apart from him. They &lt;em&gt;“study the scriptures thoroughly because they think in them they possess eternal life, and it is these same scriptures that testify about Jesus” (John 5:39)&lt;/em&gt;. The scriptures became their god instead of the true God that the words pointed them to. In their mistaken notions, they pile the burden of the keeping of the law on believers, which in effect drives a wedge between them and God. The apostle Paul wrote clearly about this faulty belief as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A person is &lt;strong&gt;not justified by the works of the law, but by faith in Jesus Christ&lt;/strong&gt;. So we, too, have put our faith in Christ Jesus that we may be justified by faith in Christ and not by the works of the law, because &lt;strong&gt;by the works of the law no one will be justified&lt;/strong&gt; (Galatians 2:16).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, some may argue that they don’t preach the law for justification, but for sanctification. But the end result is the same, that though God may by his grace and mercies saves anyone who is in Christ, a believer’s life becomes a perpetual motion in trying to become “more sanctified,” to “please the Lord,” and even to meet expectations of others though oftentimes they are not at all based on any Biblical truths. Even demons believe certain things about God (James 2:19) but they’re far from having a trust relationship with God. Such is a relationship that many have with God. They view God through a lens almost universally held by all religions of the world. They see a God with expectations and goals that are impossible to achieve. They see a God who is ready to nail them for every little mistake they make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their burden is not physical, but purely a spiritual one. They always felt they needed to get right with God through the keeping of the law. We saw this in the book of Acts, when the apostles and leaders of the church in Jerusalem met to debate whether to impose the law of Moses on Gentile believers, the apostle Peter argued against it saying:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;Brothers, you know that some time ago God chose me to preach to the Gentiles so they would hear the message of the gospel and believe. &lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;And God, who knows the heart, has testified to them by giving them the Holy Spirit just as he did to us, &lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;and he made no distinction between them and us, cleansing their hearts by faith. &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;So now why are you putting God to the test by &lt;strong&gt;placing on the neck of the disciples a yoke that neither our ancestors nor we have been able to bear?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;On the contrary, we believe that we are saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus, in the same way as they are (Acts 15:7-11).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The burden that neither their ancestors nor they could bear. This was the type of burden that Jesus promised he would deliver us from. Therefore, the deliverance from the demand of the law was the “rest” that Jesus hinted at when he made the promise in Matthew 11:28. It was also this rest that the author of Hebrews 4:11 asks us to make every effort to enter into. And it is also this rest that God had given the Israelites in the form of the observance of the Sabbath day as a foreshadow of the true rest in Christ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;jesus-yoke-and-burden&quot;&gt;Jesus’ yoke and burden&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus’ yoke and burden is the cross and the sin of the world. When he asks us to take his yoke, he does not mean it in the same way most folks understand. His yoke is the cross that requires his death, and only his death is meaningful as it is the only sacrifice that can meet God’s requirement as the payment for the sin of the world. Therefore he could not have asked us to do the thing that only he could do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore to take up Jesus’ yoke can only mean to accept his free gift of the cross as if we ourselves died on the cross. This truth is presented in several passages in Scriptures that the death that was counted toward us was a done deal, that though we haven’t physically died, we are considered dead toward everything that Jesus died for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We were therefore buried with him&lt;/strong&gt; through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life (Romans 6:4).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;But now, &lt;strong&gt;having died&lt;/strong&gt; to what bound us, we &lt;strong&gt;have been released from the Law&lt;/strong&gt;, so that we serve in the new way of the Spirit, and not in the old way of the written code (Romans 7:6).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you noticed the past tense in these verses? We’re still alive and yet we were considered as buried with Christ, as having died and been released from the law. It’s the same way with the yoke that Jesus took and counted it toward us so our debt may be considered paid in full.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus paid it all so we may enter that precious rest that all of mankind have been longing for since the time of Adam. Jesus took the burden, the burden so huge that it encompasses all of the sins of man since the beginning of time and forevermore, so that we don’t have to bear it. The need to continually pay for each and every single sin of ours is now replaced by the once-for-all payment by the Son of God on the cross. Now those who accept Jesus’ payment as his own may rest. And this rest is not just a nice thing to have, it’s actually commanded to us in Scriptures:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Let us, therefore, make every effort to enter that rest (Hebrews 4:11).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effort we must make is not in doing something no matter how noble, but in trying to get into that place of rest. This is contrary to common belief in Christian living where the idea of rest is usually associated with laziness, with the abuse of God’s grace, and busyness is almost always exalted as a virtue. Hence the call to rest, as in the story of Mary and Martha where Jesus praised Mary for choosing the better thing, the resting at his feet, as the better choice that no one can take away from her, becomes a best kept secret, or to some others a heresy that must be banned from pulpits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it shouldn’t be a secret as our Redeemer talked about it often while he was here on earth. He talked about rest, about the setting of the captives free, about living water that satisfies forever, about burden lifted, and about the forgiveness of sin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;its-finished&quot;&gt;It’s finished&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no greater proclamation of the call to rest than what Jesus uttered on the cross at his final moment: &lt;em&gt;“It’s finished!” (John 19:30)&lt;/em&gt;. To the weary and heavily burdened who grew to understand what Jesus meant, this utterance is the split in the curtain that separated them from God, it’s the parting of the Red Sea, it’s the resurrection of the Christ, of the proclamation of the accessibility of the throne of grace, and of practical down-to-earth importance, it’s a huge boulder off their back that they can now stop trying to measure up to God’s impossible standard. Jesus did all that was needed by us to please God, or in other words, Jesus fulfilled all that God required of us to meet his standard of righteousness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are thereby permitted to lay your burden down, to stop trying to be “like God, knowing good and evil” and to start trusting in God who really knows good and evil, who not only knows what good for you to do and what bad for you to avoid but also to give you his creative power to accomplish his will as he has already prepared for you even before you were formed in your mother’s womb. The apostle Paul wrote this of himself that it was God who set him apart from his mother’s womb and called him by his grace to preach the gospel among the Gentiles (Galatians 1:15). What was Paul doing before this calling? Did he earnestly pray that God would call him into ministries? Did he prepare himself for the great task ahead? Did the church lay hands and pray upon him that God would use him mightily? None of the above. On the contrary, he was the enemy of the gospel. God did this to Paul, and to us, so that none among us can claim any credit toward any works of God, so that there would be no doubt in anyone’s mind that God is the author of all good works toward his kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter into God’s rest. It’s the better thing for you to choose and no one can take it away from you. It is the unfinished business with God, the unfinished business with sin and the law, that robs you of the peace, the abundant life, the living water, that Jesus promised you when he invited you to put your trust in him. Trust him. Your business with God, sin, and the law was finished, and Christ made sure of that at Calvary. You are no longer in debt. Come home and rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And they shall teach no more every man his neighbor, and every man his brother, saying, Know the LORD: for they shall all know me, from the least of them to the greatest of them, said the LORD: for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more (Jeremiah 31:34).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grace and peace be with you&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary type="text">Before Jesus took his last breath on the cross, he said: “It’s finished.” So just as God rested after he completed the work of creation, Jesus rested after he completed the work of saving man. It is his will that we enter this rest, yet so many Christians do not experience it, their walk with God is still weighed down with burdens as they try to achieve what only Jesus could achieve for them, and he had already done so.</summary>

    &lt;p&gt;Many are concerned that the unlimitted teaching of grace will cause many to fall into antinomianism, and take advantage of the grace of God and find a license to sin. However Dr. Chalmers, an 18th century theologian, attempts to show us in his writing that such is not a case in the Christian experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://vacsf.org/viet-studies/The-Godspel-Freer-More-Sanctifying-Viet/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Bấm vào đây để đọc tiếng Việt)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dr-chalmers-on-the-gospel&quot;&gt;Dr. Chalmers on the gospel&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Thus it is, that &lt;strong&gt;the freer the Gospel, the more sanctifying&lt;/strong&gt; is the Gospel; and the more it is received as a doctrine of grace, the more will it be felt as a doctrine according to godliness.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This is one of the secrets of the Christian life, that &lt;strong&gt;the more a man holds of God, the greater is the payment of service&lt;/strong&gt; that he renders back again.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;On the tenure of “&lt;strong&gt;Do this and live&lt;/strong&gt;,” a spirit of fearfulness is sure to enter; and the jealousies of a legal bargain chase away all confidence from the intercourse between God and man; and the creature striving to be square and even with his Creator, is, in fact, pursuing all the while his own selfishness, instead of God’s glory; and with all the conformities which he labours to accomplish, the soul of obedience is not there, the mind is not subject to the law of God, nor indeed under such an economy ever can be.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;It is only when, as in the Gospel, acceptance is bestowed as a present, without money, and without price, that the security which man feels in God is placed beyond the reach of disturbance - or, that he can repose in Him, as one friend reposes in another - or, that any liberal and generous understanding can be established betwixt them - the one party rejoicing over the other to do him good - the other finding that the truest gladness of his heart lies in the impulse of a gratitude, by which it is awakened to the charms of a new moral existence.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Salvation by grace - salvation by free grace - salvation not of works, but according to the mercy of God - salvation on such a footing is not more indispensable to the deliverance of our persons from the hand of God’s justice, than it is to the deliverance of our hearts from the chill and the weight of ungodliness.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Retain a single shred or fragment of legality with the Gospel, and we raise a topic of distrust between man and God.  We take away from the power of the Gospel to melt and to conciliate.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;For this purpose, the freer it is, the better it is. That very peculiarity which so many dread as the germ of antinomianism, is, in fact, the germ of a new spirit, and a new inclination against it.  Along with the light of a free Gospel, there enters the love of the Gospel, which, in proportion as we impair the freeness, we are sure to chase away.  And never does the sinner find within himself so mighty a moral transformation, as when he is under the belief that he is saved by grace, for he feels constrained thereby to offer his heart a devoted thing, and to deny ungodliness.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;some-key-thoughts-as-gleaned-from-the-excerpt&quot;&gt;Some key thoughts as gleaned from the excerpt&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-gospel-the-freer-the-more-sanctifying&quot;&gt;The Gospel, the freer the more sanctifying&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrary to conventional thinking which believes that the preaching of a free gospel will lead to folks finding licence to sin or excuse to abuse God’s grace, Dr Chalmers as well as I believe that a freer gospel will lead to more godliness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;do-this-and-live&quot;&gt;Do this and live&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Old Covenant can be summarized to the concept of “Do this and live,” carefully observing all the commandments written in the book of the law, &lt;em&gt;“Keep[ing] this Book of the Law always on your lips; meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do everything written in it. Then you will be prosperous and successful (Joshua 1:8).”&lt;/em&gt; Ironically the Bible calls this the law of sin and death, and in the same Romans 8:2 passage Paul suggest a new law of the Spirit of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the old law, there is fear, and there is jealousy as one is never certain of God’s acceptance, and in trying to repay God for what He’s done, the person become excessively obsessed toward self instead of God’s glory, and lastly though there is an appearance of obedience, it’s not from the heart, but from fear of punishment. Such is the nature of a “legal bargain” where everything must be earned and paid for. There is always the possibility that your performance is not good enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-more-a-man-holds-of-god-the-greater-the-payment-of-service&quot;&gt;The more a man holds of God, the greater the payment of service&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would probably not go as far as calling the work, that God has prepared beforehand for those who have come to Him by grace and through faith, a payment of service, but even if such a term is used, that God does indeed demand a payment, a man cannot pay more than what he received from God. &lt;em&gt;“The more a man holds of God”&lt;/em&gt;, as Dr Chalmers puts it, means the more he understands the height, depth, and breadth of God’s forgiveness through Christ, the full righteousness that he can be certain of as he puts his trust in Him, the freedom from all condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus, and the all things that God has given him along with His Son, the more he can be an instrument in the hand of God to do the work that is not based on the law, but on faith and purified by grace. In short, the more a man knows his &lt;a href=&quot;http://vacsf.org/articles/The-Will-of-God/&quot;&gt;inheritance in Christ&lt;/a&gt;, the more he can pay, not from the works of his flesh, but from the riches that God had already reserved for him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;acceptance-bestowed-as-a-present&quot;&gt;Acceptance bestowed as a present&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without money, and without price. Only then can there be security and true rest just like a friend is relaxed in the presence of another, and if there is anything the one does for the other, it is from a heart filled with gratitude. This is a new moral existence that is to be desired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;heart-that-knows-its-full-acceptance&quot;&gt;Heart that knows its full acceptance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As important as the truth of salvation by grace, it is of no less importance the deliverance of the heart from the fear and burden of our not being fully accepted by God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;if-there-is-but-a-single-shred-of-legality-with-the-gospel&quot;&gt;If there is but a single shred of legality with the gospel&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The power of the gospel lies in its ability to forgive man and to reconcile them with God, therefore if any amount of legality is implied in the gospel as it is presented, it will take away that power and causes serious distrust between a man and his God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-freer-the-better-is-the-gospel&quot;&gt;The freer the better is the gospel&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Chalmers says it best: “And never does the sinner find within himself so mighty a moral transformation, as when he is under the belief that he is saved by grace, for he feels constrained thereby to offer his heart a devoted thing, and to deny ungodliness.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary type="text">Many are concerned that the unlimitted teaching of grace will cause many to fall into antinomianism, and take advantage of the grace of God and find a license to sin. However Dr. Chalmers, an 18th century theologian, attempts to show us in his writing that such is not a case in the Christian experience.</summary>

    &lt;p&gt;One mistranslated word can completely change the meaning of a verse. The mistranslation though may have been unintentional, it could reflect the theology of the translator; the implication can be profound, as it affects how people view their relationship with God, and consequently leads them astray.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-has-someone-become-a-sinner&quot;&gt;How has someone become a sinner?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://vacsf.org/assets/images/ephesians21-teaser.jpg&quot; style=&quot;border: 1px solid #cccccc; margin: 7px 15px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 148px; padding: 0px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;
There is almost always a great discrepancy between what a Christian believes theologically and what they believe in their heart which is reflected in the outworking of such belief. Their perception of the origin of their sin is what this article will address. This perception will in turn influence their understanding of the forgiveness of God which decidedly will characterize their relationship with God. The issue of sin and death is profoundly intertwined with forgiveness and life; if sin is misunderstood, so will it be with forgiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a previous article, &lt;a href=&quot;http://vacsf.org/articles/When-The-Son-Sets-You-Free/&quot;&gt;“When The Son Sets You Free”&lt;/a&gt;, I cited an example of a man who was practically dead in every way from the effect of drug addiction. He contributed nothing toward his eventual deliverance; all his effort to quit ended up in the desire for more, to the point he was so wasted that he was waiting for death to overtake him; if there was an inkling in his mind of a deity somewhere that he could pray to, he would, but he was too far gone to bother; he must have felt completely forsaken. So I quoted Ephesians 2:1 to illustrate God’s salvation to even one at such a dead state as him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As for you, you were dead in your transgressions and sins. (Ephesians 2:1)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far so good. This verse in the NIV translation, or in other translations such as KJV or NET that I often use, is fitting in describing the sad state that our drug addict was in before he was saved by the Lord. It can be universally applied to all men as &lt;em&gt;“all have sinned and fallen short of God’s glory (Romans 3:23).”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as I was confidently translating the aforementioned article into Vietnamese, I was in a bit of a shock to find the Vietnamese translation of Ephesians 2:1 saying something completely different from practically all the English versions. It says &lt;em&gt;“As for you, you were dead BECAUSE OF your transgressions and sins.”&lt;/em&gt;  I was quite taken aback upon reading such rendition of the verse. Would this mean if someone manages not to commit any transgressions or sins, they would not have been spiritually dead? That there is a possibility that there might be such a person who can defy the principle that all have sinned and fallen short of God’s glory?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually I must confess that there is a bit of malice in my thought as I discovered another such gross error in this translation; it proves my point that it is incumbent upon the reader of even such revered text as Scriptures to be vigilant in checking everything that is read against as many known and clear foundational truths as possible to avoid errors in interpretation or translation. The English versions simply help confirm the error in the Vietnamese translation, but even without them, the error is easily spotted if the reader is well equipped with a comprehensive set of basic truths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;contradicting-other-passages&quot;&gt;Contradicting other passages&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Vietnamese translation gives the impression that if someone can resolve to not commit the sins and trespasses, they can be spiritually alive, but both Romans 3:23 quoted above, and 1 John 1:8,10 says otherwise, that it is impossible for anyone to be without sins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If we claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us. … If we claim we have not sinned, we make him out to be a liar and his word is not in us. (1 John 1:8,10)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But let us revisit the problematic Vietnamese translation of the verse so we won’t lose track of why we get here: &lt;em&gt;“As for you, you were dead BECAUSE OF your transgressions and sins.”&lt;/em&gt;  We know from the very basic understanding of the gospel that we are dead not because of the things that we do—the bad things that we do or the good things that we fail to do—, but because of who we are: sinners in need of God’s grace and mercies. We’re sinners even if we haven’t committed any sins common to man, as it is written in Romans 5:12-14:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, and in this way death came to all men, because all sinned – for before the law was given, sin was in the world. But sin is not taken into account when there is no law. Nevertheless, death reigned from the time of Adam to the time of Moses, even over those who did not sin by breaking a command, as did Adam, who was a pattern of the one to come.” (Romans 5:12-14)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;being-dead-versus-being-alive&quot;&gt;Being dead versus being alive&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the Vietnamese translation of Ephesians 2:1 holds true, people are only spiritually dead when they commit certain sins or trespasses, so when they don’t sin, assuming it’s possible, or that they have adequately paid for their sins—through means such as confession which I don’t believe they can—, they’re spiritually alive. This assumption also runs against the truth put forth in Scriptures about what makes sinners come alive: the indwelling Spirit  who is given to believers upon their faith in Christ. Let’s keep in mind that it’s their faith in Christ that counts, not their ability to resist sins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the mindset of the Vietnamese version of Ephesians 2:1, believers are like a yo-yo in their being dead and alternately being alive, as often as in their sinning and not sinning. This pattern of life may be reasonable under the Old Covenant, but it’s no longer so under the New Covenant. Under the old, the offering for the remission of sin was repeated over and over again because sin was never completely erased, but under the new, Christ was offered once for all and never to be repeated again. So for those who were dead and brought back to life through the faith in Christ, and if they, &lt;em&gt;“BECAUSE OF”&lt;/em&gt; their sins and trespasses, become dead again, and since Christ cannot be crucified again, how are they to become alive again? Through confessions of their sins? No, this cannot be, since &lt;em&gt;“without the shedding of blood, there is no remission of sins.”&lt;/em&gt; (Hebrews 9:22).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reverting-back-to-the-old-way&quot;&gt;Reverting back to the old way&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mistranslation of Ephesians 2:1 is not simply an error in translation, it’s emblematic of man’s tendency to rely on the flesh no matter what Bible versions, hence their reliance on the keeping of the law to walk with God. This is also reflected in the misinterpretation of many passages of Scriptures though they may have been correctly translated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Christ died once for all for sin, a believer also becomes alive in the Spirit once for all as they entered the trust relationship with God in Christ.  The faulty belief causes them to doubt the assurance of salvation, as they think their sins and trespasses cause them to die again, and so they’re thrown back into the loop of trying to find remedy for their sins, with “sin confession” as one among many means to ease their guilty conscience. And so they’re sent back to the desert for a complete and symbolic forty years of desert of frustration and toil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;correct-translation-of-ephesians-21&quot;&gt;Correct translation of Ephesians 2:1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As for you, you were dead in your transgressions and sins. (Ephesians 2:1)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The English translation is already correct. You were dead, just as Adam and Eve of old were dead, just like the rest of mankind who were born in corruptible flesh. All your transgressions and sins were but inevitable fruit of your flesh in which you are struggling until the day the Lord gives you an incorruptible flesh (1 Corinthians 15).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Matthew 5:48 says this about God: &lt;em&gt;‘Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.’&lt;/em&gt; Therefore, if Christ hasn’t already made you perfect, when will you be? One more revival meeting? One more communion? One more Bible verse to memorize? One more soul to win for Christ? No, if you aren’t already perfectly acceptable to God, you will never be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;if-the-son-sets-you-free&quot;&gt;If the Son sets you free&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://vacsf.org/assets/images/addiction-teaser.jpg&quot; style=&quot;border: 1px solid #cccccc; margin: 7px 15px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 148px; padding: 0px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;
What does a human heart need? What drives a person to seek relief in work, alcohol, drug, gambling, or various other forms of addiction? The mathematician and philosopher Blaise Pascal shared his understanding that there is a God-shaped vacuum in the human heart, which is really not far from the truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Bible contains roughly 500 instances of an attribute of God that is described as love, grace, mercies, compassion, or other forms of it, and 1 John 4:8 declares that God is Love. Then it stands to reason that what the aforementioned relief seekers really need is love, which is the nature of God, but they found only a temporary relief that not only didn’t last, but may even wreck their lives and the lives of those that love them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God is doing amazing things in Vietnam in healing and restoring young people whose lives had been wrecked by drug addiction. These addicts, tried as they may, they could not wrest themselves from the powerful grip of an ill that destroys both mind and body, but it was there that God’s saving grace shone ever more brightly. Once they found hope at a Christian recovery center in Vietnam, the Word of God, as they started to learn and memorize it, began to heal their minds and subsequently their bodies in such a way we could not describe as anything but miracles. All these recovered addicts virtually spoke in unison that it was God’s love, and their knowledge of it, that saved them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article will cite a testimony, one out of dozens of recorded testimonies, and perhaps hundreds of other unspoken ones, of a man who was delivered from drug addiction as a demonstration of salvation by God’s grace, then suggest that it must be by that same grace that the recovered addict must walk until their journey on earth is done. The temptation to go back to the law, hence the reliance on the strength of the flesh, is strong, and once the saved-by-grace Christian unknowingly falls back to walking by the flesh, they will find their yoke to be anything but easy  and their burden anything but light. Sadly this is the story of many Christians, and this article hopes to point them to a better way to enjoy the life that is supposed to be as abundant as Jesus had promised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;Portrait of a drug addict&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I’m the second child in a family of five siblings. I was born in 19__ in Hanoi, Vietnam, into a family of crime. My childhood was filled with pain and sorrow. Being a son of a criminal, I was rejected by my peers. These negative experiences filled the heart of an innocent child with so much pain and sorrow beyond his years. I was ashamed of my father, and hatred began to fill my heart. Then I found the next logical thing to do was to quit school and join the gang, following my father’s footsteps. The saying “the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree” was fulfilled when my brothers, similarly one after another followed the crime filled path of the family.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2&gt;Life in the gang&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I dove into the street life, getting addicted to cocaine and heroin, becoming a thief, a robber, a debt collector, a killer for hire, a drug pusher, and a pimp. I would persuade girls who just left the countryside for the big city to become prostitutes. Those who never had any experience with drugs, I let them try so they became addicts and subjected under my control. I had to pay for such sinful lifestyle with years in prison. But prison could not change me. I became even more violent and committed even more crimes upon leaving prison. Each action that followed was worse than the last. Then came the last time, in 2010, when I was released to return to my family after six years in prison. But upon returning home I lost all hope to live and survive. My whole family was broken. Some of my brothers were addicted to drugs, some were in prison. My mother was always drinking, gambling, and had no care nor love for anyone else. My wife left and re-married. I heard from someone that before she married another husband, she gave my only son away to some temple.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2&gt;Hoping to die&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;When I was in so much pain and lost all hope to live, I thought of my family, of my son, of the years in prison, and the years being addicted to drugs. I no longer wanted to live like that anymore, but I was at a dead end without an escape. In utter despair, I decided to seek an end to my life. I thought death would be the solution  to all my problems. A drug overdose seemed to be a possible solution. I then hired a motorbike taxi driver, giving him 500,000 dong (equivalent to $25 USD at the time) to buy me a powerful drug and a syringe for my suicide attempt.  However a strange thing happened as I did not die. Someone told me later that they found me already clinically dead with pupils was dilated, so they called for transportation to take me to the emergency room of a hospital. The doctors tried to resuscitate me without success. Then they announced that I was dead and transferred my body to the morgue. In the middle of the night, I woke up finding myself inside the hospital’s morgue. When I walked out, everyone was terrified thinking they had seen a ghost.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2&gt;Seeking death again&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, upon returning home, I still had no desire to live. I sought to find death once again. I locked myself in a private room with several hundred liters of liquor which I bought and put in a large container. For a straight two months and seventeen days, I did not see anyone, ate nothing except drinking alcohol. At the end of this period, there was only skin and bone left on my body. The muscles of my arms and legs had shrunken, and I was immobilized. I released bodily wastes in the same place where I stayed. I thought perhaps I would have only a few more days to live.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2&gt;My life raft&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Right around this time, my cousin who worked at the  Binh Long rehabilitation center headed by Pastor Si Tan Ngo, had some time off so he came to pay me a visit. Seeing me in my condition, he broke into tears and said, “Hai, there is one way you can be saved.” “Which way is that?” I asked. And he answered, “Follow Jesus. He saved me from sins and drugs.” Though at that moment I knew nothing about God, I told him, “Yes, let me go with you.” But during that time, I was nearly paralyzed and could not travel to Binh Long in the South. Then my cousin brought Mrs. Hoan who was Nam Quoc Trung’s mother, together with Minh Ngoc Nguyen to come and pray with me to accept Christ and then brought me to Bac Giang rehabilitation center.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2&gt;Christ entered my life&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I arrived in Bac Giang on December 17, 2010. I could never forget Christmas that year as it was the first time I came to the Bac Giang rescue center. It was the Christmas that  Jesus entered my life. I was unable to move about independently due to the two months and seventeen days without food except alcohol which caused me to suffer from mental collapse and physical weakness. Upon arrival at the center, I was brought into the prayer room, and I was awakened at the sight of a board with lyrics of the hymn “When a Child is Born” written on it. The words of the hymn broke my heart, and I mumbled and wept while singing, and kept repeating the verse,&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 5%;&quot;&gt;“A ray of hope flitters in the sky. A shiny star lights up way up high. All across the land dawns a brand new morn. This comes to pass when a child is born”.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Surely the lyrics of this hymn reflected my life, a life filled with darkness, without happiness, and without hope. But for loving me Jesus came. He is the bright light, the joy and the hope of my life.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2&gt;The recovery&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When I first arrived at the center, I was very weak, with a body weight of only about 84 lbs. I figured it would take at least six months before I could recover. But the fearful and wonderful thing was God had fully restored me, healing me in both body and mind in only a month and a half. A miracle indeed!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2&gt;Living with gratitude&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I am eternally grateful for all Jesus Christ had done for me. Were it not for Him to seek me out and save me, I would have been buried six feet under.  Since following Christ until now, there are still things in my life that still leave much to be desired, but thanks to His mercies, love and grace, He continues to forgive and lift me up. He pours His love upon me and uses me in loving and caring for the other addicts when they were first admitted to the center. I truly rejoice upon seeing them overcoming the effect of drug withdrawal, experiencing healing, and a new life in the name of Jesus. I share the joy with their parents, spouses, and children… the kind of joy that I had never known before. My hope and desire is God would use the remainder of my life to bring salvation to those being imprisoned and chained by addictions and sins like I was. So they may also experience new and blessed lives when Jesus enters their hearts. All glory be to God. Amen!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;saved-by-grace&quot;&gt;Saved by grace&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not difficult to convince anyone of the fact that this man was saved from a life of drug addiction by God’s grace, and likewise his deliverance from a sin nature which is infinitely more formidable than the power of drugs. But it’s not easy to prove to the overwhelming majority in Christianity that they are to live by God’s grace as well. Let’s quickly trace our drug addict’s journey to the light to set the stage for the case for living by God’s grace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How did this man escape the grip of drug addiction? Through sheer determination? Through obedience? Through repentance after each painful failure? Through gradual reduction of drug use? Prayer? No, he didn’t do any of the above, or perhaps he tried but failed. He was on a downward spiral to the point he attempted suicide twice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the second suicide attempt, we read that this man locked himself in a room for two months and seventeen days with hundreds of liters of liquor with the intention of drowning himself in it. Can you imagine the depth of his despair? The depression that was his darkest of nights? He was like a lost member in the valley of dry bones in Ezekiel 37. Though this man’s heart was still beating weakly inside his body of skin and bones, he was practically dead. Hope, if he had any, was all but lost, for if he had a fleeting thought of it, he’d have prayed, but this seemingly easy act of praying never made it out of his mouth. The end was so near, just a few more days, so he thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then out of the blue, perhaps by divine providence that a cousin who was working for a rehab center came to pay him a visit at that critical moment when he was hovering at the edge of oblivion. And as they say the rest is history, our addict was on his road to recovery. Ephesians 2:1 and Romans 5:8 were demonstrated in his life so beautifully:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As for you, you were dead in your trespasses and sins. (Ephesians 2:1)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us. (Romans 5:8)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This man was definitely dead in … drugs, yet Christ died for him two thousand years ago so that today he might live. His conversion, though more dramatic than most, obeys the same principle spelled out in such verses as Ephesians 2:8-9: &lt;em&gt;“For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—not by works, so that no one can boast.”&lt;/em&gt; Just as he was saved by faith, and not by the works of his efforts to quit drugs, so was he saved from spiritual death through that same faith, and not by the works of avoiding sins. If it was impossible for him to achieve freedom from addiction with his own strength, it would be infinitely more impossible for him to achieve freedom from his sin nature, by trying to avoid sinning at all cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though most Christian do not struggle with drugs like our man in the story, they do struggle with sins in general, with other forms of addiction like work, alcohol, gambling, jealousy, self pity, low self esteem, pornography, and myriad such vices. To them the struggles are just as severe as drug addiction. If the drug addict cannot wrest himself from his depraved condition, neither can they. What they all need is the power of God, not their own strength as no amount of it is enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, at this point, we have established that our recovered drug addict contributed nothing toward his salvation. Does it then stand to reason that he likewise will not be able to contribute anything toward his sanctification? If his flesh couldn’t cleanse the drugs from his system, how will it ever make him holy enough to meet God?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-joy-of-salvation&quot;&gt;The joy of salvation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most testimonies end right about here, and this man’s testimony is no exception. But in reality, here is where the story really begins. The initial moment of joy of salvation will quickly recede into the background to yield to a state of normalcy that will endure for perhaps decades until one’s journey on earth is done. But it is during this post-salvation phase that one’s root grows deep into the faith that began at the moment of repentance. There is no exception. The initial joy of salvation must transition into something more abiding, something that does not depend on transitory feelings, be they tears of joy or songs of praise or blessings received, but on something that is immovable, that will endure forever; something that is based on the character of God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, many new Christians fall into the trap of trying to hang on to this initial moment as a standard that they must measure all subsequent experiences against. The normalcy of daily humdrum become suspect that one might have fallen from grace. So the recovered addict, or the babe in Christ who had a first taste of God’s grace and mercies, frantically engages himself in activities that might propel him back to that state that may not necessarily be experienced again. They mistakenly believe that the initial joy of salvation is a measure of how God loves and accept them, hence they deduce that a decline from such emotional high is a sign that God is no longer pleased with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-different-addiction&quot;&gt;A different addiction?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is our new Christian to do? The experience he just had became a golden standard against which he must now evaluate everything. But the joy he felt, the new found freedom he just experienced, the clarity of mind that came as a result of a euphoric encounter with the divine, and many other wonderful benefits since he came to Christ, are becoming increasing elusive. In a frantic quest to get back to that wonderful beginning, our new Christian tried to get busy with everything that made sense to him in the hope of restoring the joy that has begun to fade away. Bible study, books, revival meetings, giving of testimonies, and anything that a typical Christian would do. But despite occasional moments of riding high on wings of eagle, the burden seems to get heavier with increasing efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it possible that our recovered addict had found a different addiction to replace a previous one, albeit the new addiction is not nearly as harmful as the drug-based one but still shares the common purpose of masking an inner pain and emptiness? At this point our recovered addict is now experiencing the same struggles that many Christians face on a daily basis. The initial miracles though had helped launch the new believer on a fresh start, it got him on one traveled by the rest of mankind; he’s still in the end a sinner saved by the grace of God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;trying-to-finish-by-human-efforts&quot;&gt;Trying to finish by human efforts?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recovered addict will fare no better than someone who comes to Christ in a much less dramatic fashion, in how they should live out the remainder of their lives. The irony is, drug addicts or not, though virtually all entered the kingdom of God by grace and through faith with no claim of personal merits or efforts, they all ended up reverting back to the trusting of the flesh to walk the rest of the way. The apostle Paul expressed his frustration and anger at such stupidity like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;You foolish Galatians! Who has cast a spell on you? Before your eyes Jesus Christ was vividly portrayed as crucified! &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;The only thing I want to learn from you is this: Did you receive the Spirit by doing the works of the law or by believing what you heard? &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Are you so foolish? Although you began with the Spirit, are you now trying to finish by human effort? &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;Have you suffered so many things for nothing? if indeed it was for nothing. &lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;Does God then give you the Spirit and work miracles among you by your doing the works of the law or by your believing what you heard? (Galatians 3:1-6)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You began with the Spirit, solely by trusting in Christ through God’s grace, now you’re working hard to get to the finish line? The apostle Paul calls that foolishness. It takes but a fraction of a second for someone to be saved, like this prayer &lt;em&gt;“Jesus, remember me when you come in your kingdom” (Luke 23:43)&lt;/em&gt;. But walking with God from that point on may be a long time. So if you needed to rely 100% on God’s grace and His life-giving Spirit in your 100-yard dash—and it wasn’t even a dash as you were supposed to be already dead like the drug addict in our story—to become a Christian, how in the world are you now running a marathon relying on something else, something that comes from your own merits and ability and myriad other self-exalting attributes?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the principal cause for dissatisfaction in the lives of most Christians. They started out from nothing, but they now look inward and rely on their own ability to walk the rest of the way. They started out looking up to the Savior to save them from the bottomless pit of sins, or drug addiction as in the case of our man in this story, now they look within themselves to see if there is anything they can muster up to carry them on until they reach the finish line. This reverting back to the strength of the flesh is the root of all evil that wrecks havoc in the life of believers. It is not the drug addict’s relapses that make them fall from grace, it’s his self righteousness that is his true enemy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sin-empowered-by-the-law&quot;&gt;Sin empowered by the law&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why do people go back to the reliance on the flesh that was dead in sins  before they came to Christ, the same flesh that was useless against the power of drugs as in the case of our drug addict, and the flesh that is useless to the rest of mankind in providing them the righteousness they need to become citizens of the kingdom of God?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The root cause of this pervasive problem is the lack of a full understanding of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://vacsf.org/articles/Understanding-Forgiveness/&quot;&gt;forgiveness&lt;/a&gt; that Christ accomplished for them on the cross. Though they can correctly answer all questions in a theological examination, what they know in their hearts is far from what they say they believe.  They don’t really understand the meaning of what Jesus said before he took his last breath on the cross: &lt;em&gt;“It’s finished.”&lt;/em&gt; To them there are more sins to be forgiven, more work to be done before they can meet God. Though they accept the truth that Jesus died once-for-all for all the sins of mankind on the cross, they still fear that God is still holding their sins against them, that they’re not good enough to meet God yet, and countless other reasons for their feeling inadequate in their relationship with their Lord.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What then is the purpose of Christ’s death on the cross? What is the meaning of Christ’s dying once for all for all the sins of mankind? What did he mean when he said: “It’s finished”? I’m sure most Christians know the answers to these questions, but what they cannot reconcile, or rather what they don’t dare to place their full trust in, is the full resolution to the problem of sin at the cross, now and forevermore, that Christ’s death had given them a full right to become children of God, to be citizens of his kingdom, friends of God, to be considered blameless in his eyes, and everything else that is included in God’s promise: &lt;em&gt;“He who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all–how will he not also, along with him, graciously give us ALL THINGS?” (Romans 8:32)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And best of all, the ALL-THINGS includes the very presence of God indwelling in the hearts of all who call on the name of Jesus. Can you imagine God in you, the Holy Spirit in you, and Christ in you the hope of glory? And if God is in you, why in the world do you try to &lt;em&gt;“finish by human efforts”&lt;/em&gt; (Galatians 3:3)? Why do you try to “perfect” what Christ had already completed?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This lack of trust in the all-sufficiency of Christ has driven them back into the arm of the law as they hope that their obedience will make them right with God. But there is a catch. For there is no amount of obedience, of good works, of self sacrifices, will bridge that gap between a sense of lacking, of not having arrived, and a sense of rest, of knowing that God has fully accepted them and ready to receive them into the kingdom of God. On the other hand, The only thing that can bridge the gap is the work that Christ had already done on the cross. This work is not a continuing process, like sacrifices to be repeated over and over again, but a once-for-all act that makes you perfect in God’s sight. You will still sin, as a matter of fact you may fall back into drug addiction, not once but seventy times seven, yet God will always behold you through His beloved Son: &lt;em&gt;“This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. (Matthew 3:17)”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matthew 5:48 says this about God: &lt;em&gt;“Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.”&lt;/em&gt; Therefore, if Christ hasn’t already made you perfect, when will you be? One more revival meeting? One more communion? One more Bible verse to memorize? One more soul to win to Christ? No, if you aren’t already perfectly acceptable to God, you will never be. Today, you can claim Jesus’ promise to the thief on the cross: &lt;em&gt;“Truly I tell you, today you will be with me in paradise.” (Luke 23:43)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;you-will-be-free-indeed&quot;&gt;You will be free indeed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is how you walk with God after that wondrous encounter that brought you back from the dead. That no matter how you feel, or perform while still in the flesh, God’s love and acceptance of you will be the same yesterday, today, and forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;He who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus. (Phillipians 1:6)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Are we ever more in danger of teaching an error, than when we are combatting one? For when a teacher has the ‘antinomians’ in his sights, I find he often becomes a proponent of increased endeavour, talking of the ‘necessities’ required in a ‘holy’ life, instead of rather the holy inevitabilities to be expected in the regenerate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://vacsf.org/assets/images/danger-teaser.jpg&quot; style=&quot;border: 1px solid #cccccc; margin: 7px 15px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 148px; padding: 0px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;
He talks about the necessity of obeying God’s Word, instead of the inevitability, in the truly regenerate, of living it.  ‘Only holiness brings full joy’, one says.  But isn’t that putting the cart before the horse?  Isn’t it rather;  ‘Only joy (in believing), brings genuine holiness’?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Observe how the noted theologian quoted below takes verses of Scripture that describe the intention and purpose of the sovereign God, and render them as being contingent, and thereby provisional, and thereby uncertain, contingent upon the required actions of Man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New Testament tells us that we were chosen, redeemed, and called to be holy.  The Father &quot;chose us in him [Christ] before the creation of the world to be holy and blameless in his sight&quot; (Eph. 1:4). &quot;Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her to make her holy... to present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other blemish, but holy and blameless&quot; (Eph. 5:25- 27). &quot;It is God&#39;s will that you should be holy.... God did not call us to be impure, but to live a holy life&quot; (1 Thess. 4:3,7).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But who is the prime mover here?  God is!  Has the antinomian heresy turned a Calvinist theologian into an Arminian one?!  He so quickly forgets that life does not manifest itself because of requirements imposed upon it, but life manifests that life-principle which has been implanted within, by its creator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He continues;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sanctification is not an option, but an integral part of the salvation package, just as the repentance and consecration that lead into the pursuit of holiness are integral to the response for which the gospel calls. God&#39;s plan is to save us from sin, not in sin; therefore the need for holiness must be acknowledged and accepted.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sanctification is indeed an integral part of the ‘salvation package’, but are praise for some parts of the “package” to be due to God, and some parts due to Man?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The necessity of holiness follows from the revealed conditions of assurance. No one has a right to believe that they are partakers of God&#39;s salvation unless they walk the path of conscious, purposeful obedience and service to God. In 2 Peter 1:3-11 we learn that progress in sanctification is the only way to make one&#39;s calling and election sure (that is, to make certain of it).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, our antinomian antagonist rushes to turn what is the ‘election according to grace’ into an election according to the required conditions!    The verses he quotes do not show us how to ensure our election, but reveal what fruit shall indubitably be found in the elect. The inevitable fruits of regeneration are enumerated in Scripture as encouragements to some, and warnings to others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isaiah’s words (61:1-3) are just so evocative of our deliverance from the guilt and imprisonment of the law, into the joy of the new fruitful life God has created within us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon Me, because the LORD has anointed Me To preach good tidings to the poor; He has sent Me to heal the broken-hearted, To proclaim liberty to the captives, And the opening of the prison, to those who are bound;  To proclaim the acceptable year of the LORD, And the day of vengeance of our God; To comfort all who mourn,  To console those who mourn in Zion, To give them beauty for ashes, The oil of joy for mourning, The garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; That they may be called trees of righteousness, The planting of the LORD, that He may be glorified.” (Isaiah 61:1-3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Lord Jesus came to perform these promises, He said, and here is wonderfully revealed not merely His purpose, but also His method, which method is, He has made us His planting.  He has planted us as ‘trees of righteousness’, and just as an apple seed will surely produce an apple tree, so surely will those He has planted in righteousness, grow into trees of righteousness, leading to the eternal glorifying of His name.  There are no requirements demanded of Man here.  Here is the sovereign purpose, and certain joy of God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Truly;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Who has first given to Him, And it shall be repaid to him?”  For of Him, and through Him, and to Him, are all things,  to whom, be glory forever. Amen. (Romans 11:35-36)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;LORD, You will establish peace for us, For You have done all our works in us. (Isaiah 26:12)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them. (Ephesians 2:10)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Not unto us, O LORD, not unto us, But to Your name give glory. (Psalm 115:1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article was written by AFJ, a retired pastor who is still serving God in his part of the world. One day, AFJ found this website on the Internet and we became great friends due to our common understanding of what it means to be followers of Christ. This article is really an entire email that AFJ sent me perhaps as an affirmation of my writings so I won’t lose heart in this endeavor. Thank you brother AFJ. I have learned much from you.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;How do we disciple a new believer, one who first discovered that Jesus is their messiah and had come to receive the free gift of eternal life? How do we help them grow and mature? I believe that it should be their goal to discover what Jesus had &lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt; done for them, what he had &lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt; given to them, but unfortunately this is not the view point of the majority of Christian leaders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-different-points-of-view&quot;&gt;The different points of view&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://vacsf.org/assets/images/forgiveness-teaser.jpg&quot; style=&quot;border: 1px solid #cccccc; margin: 7px 15px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 148px; padding: 0px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’re of the point of view that these new believers should start on the basis that they should now begin to live for God though they certainly must be motivated by what Christ had done for them. They must begin with leading a holy life, reducing the amount of sins in their lives, starting doing the things they should be doing, and refraining from doing the things they shouldn’t be doing. My point of view is that their focus should not be about what they should do for God, but about what God has done for them. This view is expressed rather extensively in the article &lt;a href=&quot;http://vacsf.org/articles/The-Will-of-God/&quot;&gt;The Will of God&lt;/a&gt; about what we already have in Christ, what we have received from Him as an inheritance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the precious inheritance that is guaranteed ours in Christ, forgiveness is first and foremost because without it salvation is impossible. A proper understanding of forgiveness can set you free in many ways and enable you to begin to walk into the new life that is before you in Christ Jesus. However a faulty understanding of forgiveness will paralyze you in your growth because forgiveness is truly the foundation of our faith, that Jesus died for our sins, and we’re forgiven because of what He did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt; Everyone who hears these words of mine and does them is like a wise man who built his house on rock. &lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt; The rain fell, the flood came, and the winds beat against that house, but it did not collapse because it had been founded on rock. &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt; Everyone who hears these words of mine and does not do them is like a foolish man who built his house on sand. &lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt; The rain fell, the flood came, and the winds beat against that house, and it collapsed; it was utterly destroyed! (Matthew 7:24-27)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A proper understanding of forgiveness is the foundation, the rock, upon which we build our faith, otherwise we’d be building it on the shifting sand of the flesh based view of sins and running in a mouse-wheel with lots of action without getting anywhere, to the point some may abandon the faith out of discouragement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-right-question-to-ask&quot;&gt;The right question to ask&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I were to ask a believer whether they believe that Jesus died for their sins past, present, and future, they would answer that they do believe it, however if I rephrased the question like this: “If you were to sin against God today, will He hold that sin against you?” they would most likely answer “YES,” and continue to explain that they would have to ask for forgiveness and find ways to redeem their trespasses, because if they don’t, their God may not bless them, or allow harm to come to them unless they do something about it. So we see that though theoretically, in their theological understanding, they believe one thing, in practice they live out their faith in the completely opposite way, that the issue of sin is still ever present and never completely dealt with at the cross at all. The issue of sin becomes to them a mouse-wheel of frustration that prevents them from maturing in the faith. To them the Christian life is still a continual process of dealing with sins and obtaining forgiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seeking-forgiveness&quot;&gt;Seeking forgiveness&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is useless; you are still in your sins. (1 Corinthians 15:17)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you believe that Christ had been raised? Let me ask again, do you really believe that He had been raised? If you indeed believe that He’s been raised, then you must also believe that you’re not in your sins anymore—this does not mean you either can’t, or you resolve not to, sin anymore, but it means God no longer holds your sins against you. This question may be asked a thousand times and though most Christians may answer yes equally as many times, I’m afraid they don’t really believe as they professed. Because if they do, why the obsession with trying to get forgiveness as a way of life if Christ is indeed raised? Let’s read the verse above more slowly and deliberately: &lt;em&gt;“if Christ has not been raised, your faith is useless; you are still in your sins.”&lt;/em&gt; Let’s put this verse another way, it is because of Christ’s resurrection from the dead that gives you freedom from sin, the freedom from the effect of sin, its condemnation, its standing between you and God, its deadly consequences (Romans 6:32). Christ’s resurrection guarantees that all your past, present, and future sins won’t stand between you and God, but it does not guarantee that you won’t sin again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Christ has risen, and you’re no longer in your sins, then what is standing between you and God? Your unbelief?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-sins-are-forgiven&quot;&gt;How sins are forgiven&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a period of time God gave the Israelites a temporary means for relief of sins: the offering of an unblemished lamb as an atonement. But an atonement does not provide the forgiveness of sins, because if it does, there would not have been a need for Christ. An atonement actually memorializes sins, it serves as a reminder that the worshiper is in need of the Savior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But in those sacrifices there is a &lt;u&gt;reminder of sins&lt;/u&gt; year after year. (Hebrews 10:3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the perfect once-for-all offering of the Son of God is not an atonement, but a propitiation through which our sins are actually remembered no more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;• For I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more. (Jeremiah 31:34)
• I will remember their sins and their lawless deeds no more. (Hebrews 10:17)
• There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. (Romans 8:1)
• Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come. (2 Corinthians 5:17)
• In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his grace. (Ephesians 1:7)
• in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins. (Colossians 1:14)
• Because Christ also suffered once for sins, the just for the unjust, to bring you to God, by being put to death in the flesh but by being made alive in the spirit. (1 Peter 3:18)
• I am writing to you, little children, that your sins have been forgiven because of his name. (1 John 2:12)
• And even though you were dead in your transgressions and in the uncircumcision of your flesh, he nevertheless made you alive with him, having forgiven all your transgressions. (Colossians 2:13)
• But God demonstrates his own love for us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. Much more then, because we have now been declared righteous by his blood, we will be saved through him from God’s wrath. For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son, how much more, since we have been reconciled, will we be saved by his life? (Romans 5:8-10)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The common denominator between the Old Covenant atonement and the New Covenant propitiation is the shedding of blood. And these are the only two ways God provided for the forgiveness of sins, with the old being a shadow of the true forgiveness that is ours in Christ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Indeed according to the law almost everything was purified with blood, and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness. (Hebrews 9:22)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without the shedding of blood, there is no forgiveness. The irony here is many Christians, and denominations, believe there is a way to get forgiveness without blood: an apology. But God had never provided such a way for the remission of sin. What that amounts to is no matter how well meaning is the action performed by the worshipper, remorse, recompense, repentance, obedience, rending of clothes, self beating, shedding tears of even the most contrite of hearts, a thousand recital of the most heartfelt prayers, will not achieve the forgiveness of sins without the shedding of blood, and the blood must be of no one else but the Lamb of God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In utilizing the so-called confession, or rather in practicality an apology, as means for the forgiveness of sins, the believer trivializes the enormity of sin of which even in the smallest amount is enough to cast mankind from the Garden of Eden. No, an apology won’t do as it does not meet the requirement of the shedding of blood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the continual seeking of the forgiveness of sins  proves that this believer is still in his sins, hence his belief, or his understanding, or his faith, in the resurrection of Christ is worthless (1 Corinthians 15:17), he only pays lip’s service to his belief in Christ’s resurrection but he doesn’t really believe that he’s been delivered from his sins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-forgiveness-is-necessary&quot;&gt;Why forgiveness is necessary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forgiveness is the prerequisite of salvation which is the restoration of life, the returning of the Holy Spirit, that had been lost in Adam (Ezekiel 18:20). Therefore in order for someone to inherit the kingdom of God, he must be completely without sins. And since we will still sin until the day we die, what we really need is to be completely forgiven now and forevermore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, to be no longer in sins doesn’t mean we stop sinning, but it does mean God no longer holds our sins against us, that He has already forgiven us even as He knows we cannot stop sinning. He’s no longer disgusted at us, or ashamed to call Himself our Father.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more. (Jeremiah 31:34)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The knowledge that God has already forgiven us without any condition sets us free to rightly relate to Him and to serve Him. Then we can do good works and serve God from love and not from fear of punishments or loss of blessings. It sets us free from the paralyzing fear of displeasing God. Perhaps here I should add that as fallen sinners we can never please God no matter how hard we try, except that we are in Him, the Lord Jesus Christ, who alone can please God in every way (Matthew 3:17).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about those who still live in sins, those who have to daily seek forgiveness from God? They may still be saved on the promise of God that those who call on the name of Christ will have eternal live, but until the day they meet God, their lives now are paralyzed with fear, with the uncertainty of God’s disappointment with them for the sins they still commit. That is no way to live, because Christ is risen and He’s granted that you don’t have to live in your sins anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-resistance-to-forgiveness&quot;&gt;The resistance to forgiveness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many reasons why people find it difficult to receive forgiveness or to grant forgiveness to others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;People intrinsically do not want to forgive others. They may say they do like in the Lord’s prayer, but given a right set of circumstances, perhaps they might want to kill those who have hurt them instead.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;People do not want God to forgive others. Most if not all folks have experienced things done to them unjustly and it’s only natural that they hold grudges against the perpetrators all their lives. We can easily see it in the book of Jonah.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;People do not want others to know that God had forgiven them in order that they may control or manipulate them, for if people know that God had forgiven them, the manipulators may lose the only leverage they had.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;People do not want to believe that God has forgiven them because they want to hold on to the law. But this is a great contradiction for a believer because the law has to do with punishment in the event of failure, and if God no longer holds our sins against us, what then is the role of the law? God has forgiven us because none of us can comply to even the smallest of the law, and yet so many in Christendom still parade the law as means to control the flesh.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-freedom-of-forgiveness&quot;&gt;The freedom of forgiveness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If God says He doesn’t hold our sins against us anymore, then why the issue of sins is still very much in the forefront of virtually all sermons across all mediums? It’s easy to spot a guilt-producing message, it may be cloaked in positive motivating words, but the end result is it leaves in the mind of the hearers a sense of missing the mark, of falling short of something, an expectation, especially if that something is dressed up as the will of God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story of Mary and Martha in Luke 10:38-42 demonstrates clearly the priority of forgiveness that gives Mary the freedom to relate to Jesus the way God intended. Martha must have been driven by guilt when she was doing good works, the works of serving Jesus and His disciples, the bondage she was experiencing expressed itself in her annoyance at Mary who was content at Jesus’ feet taking in His precious words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though this story didn’t mention forgiveness, it’s there if you can listen well. The forgiveness that Mary sensed from the Savior, much like that same forgiveness sensed by the Samaritan woman who drew water at Jacob’s well (John 4:1-26), gave them the freedom to rest at His feet. This is contrary to what we constantly hear from pulpits: Do’s. Lots of Do’s. To the point forgiveness sheepishly returns to its dusty corner on some book shelves of seminary as just a theological concept that has no relevance to real life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;41&lt;/sup&gt; Martha, Martha, the Lord answered, you are worried and upset about many things, &lt;sup&gt;42&lt;/sup&gt;but only one thing is needed. Mary has chosen what is better, and it will not be taken away from her. (Luke 10:41-42)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teachers of Bible place so much emphasis on other lesser things and neglect the “better” thing that Jesus commended Mary for. Unlike Jesus, they lead the Mary’s among us away from Christ to the things that He may have already prepared for them in advance. Let’s consider the following verses that also tell us what the better thing is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;For by grace you are saved through faith, and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God; &lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;it is not from works, so that no one can boast. &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;For we are his workmanship, having been created in Christ Jesus for good works that God prepared beforehand so we may do them. (Ephesians 2:8-10)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not a coincidence that these verses discourage us from trusting in good works for salvation, then in the same context assure us that it is God who will give us works to do that He’s already prepared beforehand. The forgiveness, or our full appreciation of it, must come first before anything else, otherwise trying to please an unforgiving God is slavery that has no place in the heart of God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-fear-of-forgiveness&quot;&gt;The fear of forgiveness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The large majority of Bible teachers are afraid of teaching God’s forgiveness to its full extent. It’s not about the forgiveness that is dispensed in small doses for particular transgressions, but the total forgiveness of sins that completely sets the sinner free from the fear of ever being condemned again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their rationale is a full knowledge of God’s forgiveness will give people a license to sin. While this may be true, it does not justify hiding this truth from even one person who might through the knowledge of God’s full pardon know God in proportion with what He wants to reveal through the cross.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Realistically can the covering of God’s light of forgiveness make better people out of us? For so long people mistakenly believe that the law keep people from sins, but the Bible says otherwise:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;• The law was brought in so that the trespass might increase. (Romans 5:20)
• For when we were in the realm of the flesh, the sinful passions aroused by the law were at work in us, so that we bore fruit for death. (Romans 7:5)
• The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law. (1 Corinthians 15:56)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The law actually produces the opposite effect of what people normally think. It actually increases sin so their depravity is exposed to the point all knees shall bow and call Jesus Christ Lord. That is the purpose of the law. It is the teacher to lead us to Christ, and then it’s done its job (Galatians 3:24) when God gets a hold of us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without a full trust and embrace of God’s forgiveness no one can really know God, because that’s how He’s shown Himself to the world. Forgiveness has to do with love and trust, while punishment has to do with the law and condemnation (1 John 4:18).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;antinomianism&quot;&gt;Antinomianism&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people believe that complete forgiveness cannot be taught because &lt;em&gt;“it leads an individual to the point of complete practical disregard for the law of God and a callous lack of concern for violating it.”&lt;/em&gt; This is a direct quote from a very well known preacher of grace and many people fully trust it to be true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s entirely possible that there are folks who cite God’s complete forgiveness to justify their sinful lifestyles, but in reality have you ever met one who does that? Can God who dwells in the heart of a true believer allow that to happen? Neither can an unbeliever, a normal person without serious psychological problem, overcome the power of his conscience so he may eradicate any trace of guilt. It’s rare to find antinomianism even in unbelievers because they, too, have the law of God in their conscience (Romans 2:14).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you believe in the truth that God has already completely forgiven those who trust in Him, should you because of some, even ninety nine out of a hundred, who may take advantage of it and fall into antinomianism, hide this truth from all? No, you should not. Because in doing so, you will prevent all from ever knowing God for who He really is. I’d rather risk the ninety nine and remove the stumbling block for the one so he may know his God. This knowledge of God’s total forgiveness is the only way for anyone to know God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To hide this truth from others is actually a complete disregard for the new law of God, the law of the spirit of life, the law with God’s total forgiveness as its foundation, the law which states that God no longer holds your sins against you, because Jesus paid it all, now and forevermore. Sadly so many Bible teachers still try to hold their flocks captives with the false gospel that hides the ever forgiving power of the cross of Christ. These folks indulge their own personal self interest by lying to you concerning this truth. They do that to put you under their control and influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;“The days are coming,” declares the Lord,
    “when I will make a &lt;strong&gt;new&lt;/strong&gt; covenant
with the people of Israel
    and with the people of Judah.
&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It will not be like&lt;/strong&gt; the covenant
    I made with their ancestors
when I took them by the hand
    to lead them out of Egypt,
because they broke my covenant,
    though I was a husband to[a] them,[b]”
declares the Lord.
&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt;“This is the covenant I will make with the people of Israel
    after that time,” declares the Lord.
“I will put my law in their minds
    and write it on their hearts.
I will be their God,
    and they will be my people.
&lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt;No longer will they teach their neighbor,
    or say to one another, ‘Know the Lord,’
because they will all know me,
    from the least of them to the greatest,”
declares the Lord.
“For I will forgive their wickedness
    and will &lt;strong&gt;remember their sins no more&lt;/strong&gt;. (Jeremiah 31:31-34)”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the covenant you’re living under is anything like the old covenant, it’s not the new covenant. In the new covenant, God will &lt;em&gt;“remember your sins no more.”&lt;/em&gt; And if this is true and you believe it, what else is there to forgive? Or does God still hold your sins against you? Then you don’t know God at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The work of forgiving those who come to the cross is completed. IT’S FINISHED!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;license-to-sin&quot;&gt;License to sin&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The labeling of the teaching of God’s total forgiveness of sins as giving people a license to sin is categorically erroneous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us use a real life example such as a driver’s license. This license is given to a driver with rules governing what he can, or cannot, do in order to maintain safety. The issuance of this license also imply penalty upon failure to obey driving rules and how such penalty may be redeemed so the driver can continue to drive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this sense, it is the purveyor of the law who is giving people license to sin, as they give people a set of rules on what they can or cannot do, along with penalties which may be the threat of the loss of salvation or of blessings, and means for redemption which is generally accepted as a confession of sins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These folks gives people an illusion of a forgiveness of sins through confession that does not deliver what it promises. In the “How sins are forgiven” above we learned that in order for sins to be forgiven there must be the shedding of blood, and it must be the blood of the Son of God, not of bulls or goats. Then how is it that a mere verbal confession, or a more down to earth expression of an apology, can achieve what only Christ could?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This confession as means for forgiveness is not only a license to sin, it is a deceptive one at best. We will delve into this topic of sin confession in the next section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;john-19&quot;&gt;1 John 1:9&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But if we confess our sins, he is faithful and righteous, forgiving us our sins and cleansing us from all unrighteousness. (1 John 1:9)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This verse is normally used to support the idea that a confession, an apology, can be used to obtain forgiveness. As we’ve discussed previously, this approach shows its adherent do not take sins seriously. If it took Jesus on the cross to forgive our sins, how is it that now we can achieve the same thing just by mere confession? The Bible says that the wages of sin is death(Romans 6:23), now we trivialize them to be just simple apologies. This circumventing of the cross is from the devil, and yet it is predominantly the teaching of the church.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you believe 1 John 1:9 is the way to achieve forgiveness as a way of life, you have no life. This verse has no application to a believer’s life. Let us find out why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Dr. John Best, a Greek scholar, of the Dallas Theological Seminary, this verse should be translated from Greek to English as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I don’t know if you are ever to come to your senses and agree with God concerning your sins, but if any time, today, tomorrow, or whenever you should decide to turn to Him, God can be depended upon to &lt;strong&gt;have forgiven&lt;/strong&gt; your sins and to have cleansed you of all unrighteousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And all this is in the &lt;u&gt;past tense&lt;/u&gt; in the context of salvation. You are already the beneficiary of this forgiveness that he has ALREADY given to you. How? By the death of Jesus on the cross. When? Two thousand years ago. This was the execution of forgiveness for humanity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let’s go back to the verse before 1 John 1:9.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If we say we do not bear the guilt of sin, we are deceiving ourselves and the truth is not in us. (1 John 1:8)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What kind of a person thinks he has no sins? It’s obvious this is not a saved person, an unbeliever, because there is no believer who thinks he has no sins. What then should this person do if he wants to be saved? He must acknowledge that he’s a sinner, that he’s not without sins, and confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, that apart from what He did on the cross he has no hope of salvation. In this sense, and it is the context intended by the author, this confession is the confession of faith, to obtain the forgiveness once for all for salvation, not the kind practiced daily by most Christians. In practicing the daily confession for forgiveness of sins, the Christians say Jesus’ death on the cross was insufficient and they have to add to it with further confessions until the day they die. This practice is another gospel which is is not what the apostle Paul was preaching. The person who holds this belief must answer: Is death the wage of sin, or is it a confession?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, if we move forward to the beginning of the next chapter, we’ll see even more proof that the means of forgiveness is not a confession, but something else, something that lines up perfectly with the foundation of the gospel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;My dear children, I write this to you so that you will not sin. But if anybody does sin, we have an advocate with the Father—Jesus Christ, the Righteous One. &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for ours but also for the sins of the whole world (1 John 2:1-2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does the verse say: if you do sin, confess? No. It says: if you do sin, you have Christ who is your defender. There is no mentioning here of any penalty, such as a confession, of any method of recompense, or even forgiveness, but a line of defense. And the defense doesn’t say: please forgive this child, but it says: he’s not guilty, because I, Jesus, paid it all already at Calvary. This is the reason why the apostle Paul boldly wrote, without any fear of anyone taking advantage of his pronouncement, the following verse that was revealed to him from God Himself:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus (Romans 8:1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there is now no condemnation, then what is forgiveness for? Therefore 1 John 1:9 is a call to an unbeliever to come to an agreement with God that he’s a sinner in need of God’s grace. It’s not for a believer, and it has no application in a believer’s life such as confession to obtain forgiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-confession&quot;&gt;Why confession?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is this practice of confession so prevalent if it’s not in the Bible? There are several reasons from both the practitioners and those that promote it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some say they experience a sense of peace after they confess their sins. Granted there might be positive psychological effects from being able to unload guilty feelings, but in my experience, the benefit doesn’t last. Additionally, the practice does not bring the forgiveness of sins as it’s purported to do. The Bible says that there must be the shedding of blood for sins to be forgiven, but according to Hebrews 10:26, shedding of animal blood, or even the blood of Christ, is no longer accepted by God; it is finished with Christ. For an unbeliever, his sins can be forgiven once for all through faith in Christ, for believer, he’s already forgiven now and forevermore.  Therefore for a Christian, if God says He doesn’t remember their sins no more (Jeremiah 31:34; Hebrews 8:12), what then can be achieved by reminding Him of our sins through the act of confession?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For leaders in a legalistic church, holding their flocks under sin give them the benefit of their dependence on them, it provides job security. These leaders may or may not know about the truth that the issue of sins has been resolved at the cross two thousand years ago; if they don’t, it’s not only that they walk in confusion, they also lead others on the same path; if they do and they chose to disregard the truth and chose to lead others astray … ? At any rate, the tendency to use guilt to control others is common within or without Christianity. Confession is a leash that prevents Christians from realizing the freedom they have through Christ’s total forgiveness of their sins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lords-prayer&quot;&gt;The Lord’s prayer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the Lord’s prayer in Matthew 6:14-15, we read:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; For if you forgive other people when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; But if you do not forgive others their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins. (Matthew 6:14-15)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In these verses God gives us a recipe for receiving forgiveness from Him: forgive others when they sin against us. But if we know ourselves, can we honestly say that we’ll be able to forgive anyone under any circumstances? Will we be able to forgive someone who might possibly commit the worst act of atrocity upon us?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, let us not forget that in order for anyone to enter the kingdom of God, he must be completely forgiven by God, to the point he can be as perfect as is required by God (Matthew 5:48). Jesus declared this requirement of perfection after He gave what we now call the Sermon on the Mount. He raised the bar so high with the intention of demolishing all prideful arrogance of those who think they can somehow achieve the perfection of God with their own fleshly efforts. So it was with the Matthew verses quoted above. Jesus didn’t give that requirement as a golden rule for us to follow, but as a means to put us where we really belong: sinners in need of God’s grace and mercies, because no one even come close to being able to forgive anyone in its truest meaning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;being-forgiven&quot;&gt;Being forgiven&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The universal truth is no one is righteous, or to put it another way, everyone is a sinner. Except for some whose conscience does not seem to have a strong influence on their lives, the rest will get on some paths trying to become better people, through obedience, repentance, or other ways to reach this noble goal. If there is even a slightest hint of honesty in the hearts of such people, they would soon come to the place of realization that the effort to become better people, to banish sins from their lives, is futile. However, there may be others who are more persistent their quest for personal excellence even until the time they lay on their deathbed. The strangest thing is even though all will never have achieved their state of perfection, they attempt to teach others how to do what they know will end in failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The honest seekers will come to a place where they realize they are in need of God’s forgiveness. They realize all their efforts in obedience and repentance will not bring them any closer to the state of perfection. They fell too far short of the glory of God. What they need is God’s forgiveness. Much like a drug addict under the spell of the powerful mind altering substance becomes absolute slave to it. Obedience and repentance to a Christian is like pep talk or imploring as they will fall on deaf ears, as the only thing an addict hears is the voice of his delusional mind which cannot be trusted. Addicts or sinners, they need forgiveness for the sins they WILL commit.  An addict doesn’t need to confess whenever he fails under the spell of the cravings for drugs. He knows it, and he hates it. He desperately needs to get out from under the bondage of drugs that is stronger than steel. But there is something stronger than steel: it’s God’s enduring forgiveness that sets him free and empowers him to begin anew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;forgiving-others-and-conclusion&quot;&gt;Forgiving others, and conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is a debt forgiven? If a debt can be paid up but the creditor decides not to pursue payment, then it’s not a forgiveness of the debt, but a gift. A debt is only truly forgiven if the debtor cannot repay it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from money, there are debts that one person owes another that cannot be repaid. Such debt as the taking of lives, acts of injustice, abuse, etc., cannot be repaid with mere apologies, or confessions as usually offered by Christians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What then does Jesus mean when he asks us to forgive others? We forgive others, with a firm conviction that they can never repay, in the same way God has forgiven us. I don’t know about you but I’m not sure if I can really forgive someone the way God does. I can’t guarantee that there won’t be moments I secretly require a payment in my heart, when I entertain the thoughts of vengeance, but I know God can forgive as He said. He sent His Son to the cross even when we were still sinners like the drug addict howling in agony and in a frantic search for his next fix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not an easy thing to know and fully believe that God has forgiven us and has cast our sins as far as the East is from the West, as the bottom of the sea is from the high heavens. It’s not easy to believe that God no longer counts our sins against us. But we can only forgive others in proportion to how we know and experience God’s forgiveness for us. We cannot outdo Him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what are you doing whispering in God’s ears what God had banished by sending His precious Son to the cross?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;credit&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I owe a debt of gratitude to brother Aaron Budjen who produced a life changing series of 12 sermons with the same title: &lt;a href=&quot;http://livinggodministries.net&quot;&gt;“Understanding Forgiveness”&lt;/a&gt;—please click on the link at left to access the full series in mp3 format—that this article is derived from as well as much of its content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I was near completion of this writing, a wonderful opportunity came with a request that I serve as an editor for a book being translated into English from Vietnamese. The book consists of testimonies from people who suffered from drug addiction but had been delivered miraculously by the power of the love of God. The testimonies that I had the privilege to edit gave me just the perfect closing thoughts to bring home the key concept of God’s complete forgiveness that took a while to build. Thank you the VCRM team for making me a part of this wonderful project.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;!-- &lt;p&gt;The Lord’s Supper and the Christian Communion. Understanding it from the Passover context.&lt;/p&gt;
 --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Christians usually are advised to examine themselves in preparation for the communion based on the passage in 1 Corinthians 11, but most assuredly the passage they should base it on is Matthew 26 which recorded what is known as The Lord’s Supper, which in turn should be understood from the context of the Passover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;matthew-2617-30&quot;&gt;Matthew 26:17-30&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;On the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to Jesus and asked, “Where do you want us to make preparations for you to eat the Passover?”
&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;He replied, “Go into the city to a certain man and tell him, ‘The Teacher says: My appointed time is near. I am going to celebrate the Passover with my disciples at your house.’” &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;So the disciples did as Jesus had directed them and prepared the Passover.
&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;When evening came, Jesus was reclining at the table with the Twelve. &lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;And while they were eating, he said, “Truly I tell you, one of you will betray me.”
&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;They were very sad and began to say to him one after the other, “Surely you don’t mean me, Lord?”
&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;Jesus replied, “The one who has dipped his hand into the bowl with me will betray me. &lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him. But woe to that man who betrays the Son of Man! It would be better for him if he had not been born.”
&lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt;Then Judas, the one who would betray him, said, “Surely you don’t mean me, Rabbi?”
Jesus answered, “You have said so.”
&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;While they were eating, Jesus took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and gave it to his disciples, saying, “Take and eat; this is my body.”
&lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt;Then he took a cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, saying, “Drink from it, all of you. &lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt;This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins. &lt;sup&gt;29&lt;/sup&gt;I tell you, I will not drink from this fruit of the vine from now on until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father’s kingdom.”
&lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt;When they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives. (Matthew 26:17-30)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-communion&quot;&gt;The Communion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://vacsf.org/assets/images/communion-teaser.jpg&quot; style=&quot;border: 1px solid #cccccc; margin: 7px 15px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 148px; padding: 0px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;
This passage along with another passage in 1 Corinthians 11:27-29 are regularly used to prepare the congregation prior to their receiving of the communion bread and wine. There are a few points of emphasis in these passages but perhaps the main focus is placed on &lt;em&gt;“unworthy manner”&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;“self examination”&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;“judgement”&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt;So then, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an &lt;u&gt;unworthy manner&lt;/u&gt; will be guilty of sinning against the body and blood of the Lord. &lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt;Everyone ought to &lt;u&gt;examine themselves&lt;/u&gt; before they eat of the bread and drink from the cup. &lt;sup&gt;29&lt;/sup&gt;For those who eat and drink without discerning the body of Christ eat and drink &lt;u&gt;judgment&lt;/u&gt; on themselves.” (1 Corinthians 11:27-29)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had always thought this was the right way to prepare myself for communion for decades before I came to a full grasp of law and grace that encouraged me to take another look at it from the whole context.  No wonder communion Sunday was for me such a mixture of a heavy heart and a longing for deliverance that was never realized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’d be all standing up while the Corinthians passage is read, then following its admonition we’d examine ourselves to see if we’re now worthy to receive the Lord’s body and blood. There is no need for any explanation, we each would summon our internal judge, our conscience, during this time of quiet reflection, to evaluate our worthiness before we receive the communion articles. It’s not clear what we’ve done during the week, perhaps for an average Christian we’ve done nothing out of the ordinary except getting up in the morning to prepare and then go through the challenges of the day in family and in the workplace.  Just mundane and routine stuff. But if they feel these mundane and routine stuff is less than what they think is the Lord’s will for their lives, then guilt begins to take hold, which would explain how many feel before the communion: We’re unworthy. No matter which way you look at it, you end up feeling unworthy, but you receive the communion anyway while hoping this act of eating the bread and drinking the grape juice would provide a certain amount of relief for your sin-sicked soul.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this is a wrong application of the Corinthians passage. Paul wrote this passage to address an issue of bad conducts of some folks who come to eat together without concern for others. Let’s read from the passage that just precedes the call for the communion receivers to examine themselves:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;So then, when you come together, it is not the Lord’s Supper you eat, &lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;for when you are eating, some of you go ahead with your own private suppers. As a result, one person remains hungry and another gets drunk. &lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;Don’t you have homes to eat and drink in? Or do you despise the church of God by humiliating those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you? Certainly not in this matter!” (1 Corinthians 11:20-22)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to see that the self examination has nothing to do with anything other than the immediate act of the receiving of communion. But one may ask: What about sins during the days, or weeks, leading to communion Sunday?  The answer will be that we must trust that the Lord will work with the individuals in His time and according to His way in His infinite wisdom, all we know is the issue with communion in this context is just what we read from the passage. As a matter of fact, this passage should not even be read during communion today as it’s unlikely that people will fight for the little chip and a little cup of grape juice to warrant such exhortation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now with the issue of self examination and worthiness concerning communion out of the way, we can focus on the true meaning of the Lord’s Supper with the hope that a proper understanding will gladdens our hearts as we’re wonderfully reminded of what great thing Christ has done for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-passover&quot;&gt;The Passover&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Lord’s Supper is in essence the Passover observance as we read in verse 18: &lt;em&gt;“My appointed time is near. I am going to celebrate the Passover with my disciples at your house. (Matthew 26:18)”&lt;/em&gt; However this Passover now has a different New Covenant meaning as we shall see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God gave the Isrealites a commandment to remember the bondage they had when they were still in Egypt and how He delivered them and brought them to the promised land. In this Passover observance a lamb which must be unblemished must be specially chosen to be offered as a sacrifice, and it must be consumed following a strict guideline. The Passover must be observed on the 14th day of the month in the Jewish calendar which was based on the barley harvest and the day of the most recent full moon and was different from year to year. Anyone who missed this day must return to Jerusalem on the 14th day of the following month to observe the festival. This is a very important commandment that must be observed by everyone in Israel in Jerusalem or they will be cut off from the nation for the rest of their lives, and it must be observed only in Jerusalem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is much more  that can be that can be said about the historical background and meaning of the Old Covenant Passover which would help us appreciate much more the meaning of the New Covenant version of it that is either known as the Lord’s Supper or the Communion that Christian churches observe periodically. However the main goal of this writing is to point out misinterpretations and misapplications of the Lord’s Supper that create much confusion and deprive the joy of salvation that should have been brought forth from the observance of this blessed event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;under-the-old-covenant&quot;&gt;Under the Old Covenant&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The name Passover describes the event surrounding the tenth plague after which the Egyptian Pharaoh capitulated and set his captives free.  On the night of this tenth plague when the Lord would have unleashed his wrath upon Egypt to take away all their first born sons, the Israelites were instructed to apply lamb’s blood above every door that leads into their homes in which case the Lord would &lt;strong&gt;passover&lt;/strong&gt; them and they would be spared. But for the Egyptians:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“About midnight I will go throughout Egypt. Every firstborn in Egypt will die, from the firstborn son of Pharaoh, who sits on the throne, to the firstborn of the slave girl, who is at her hand mill, and all the firstborn of the cattle as well. There will be loud wailing throughout Egypt—worse than there has ever been or ever will be again.” (Exodus 11:4–6)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;under-the-new-covenant&quot;&gt;Under the New Covenant&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the blood that sets us apart from the world is not one of ordinary lamb, but of the Lamb of God, and though it does not spare us of physical death, it gives us eternal life through the indwelling Holy Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkled on those who are ceremonially unclean sanctify them so that they are outwardly clean. How much more, then, will the &lt;strong&gt;blood of Christ&lt;/strong&gt;, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself unblemished to God, cleanse our consciences from acts that lead to death, so that we may serve the living God! (Hebrews 9:13-14)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;whats-the-difference&quot;&gt;What’s the difference?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though the Old Covenant’s blood blessed the Israelites, or those who lived under the law, in the flesh by sparing them physical death, the New Covenant’s blood gives them life everlasting. The old only made them ceremonially and outwardly clean, the new actually made it possible for us to serve God. The shedding of the old blood must be continually repeated while the new blood is shed once for all for the sins of the whole world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day after day&lt;/strong&gt; every priest stands and performs his religious duties; &lt;strong&gt;again and again&lt;/strong&gt; he offers the same sacrifices, &lt;strong&gt;which can never take away sins&lt;/strong&gt;. (Hebrews 10:11)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;But when this Priest had offered for all time &lt;strong&gt;one sacrifice&lt;/strong&gt; for sins, He sat down at the right hand of God (Hebrews 10:12)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you notice a critical difference between the Old and the New in how sins are taken away? No matter how earnest and sincere the worshipper is, any sacrifice whatsoever from him, be it a burnt sacrifice, or a confession of sin, or even an attempt to recompense for a bad deed, a huge amount of remorse, self flagellation, a composition or singing of a most beautiful song of praise, or whatever a sin wrecked soul can conjure up to make amends, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;none&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; of these things can &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;take away sins&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Only Christ can. Of course you should do all those things listed above because they’re good for your well being, but keep in mind that they don’t take away your sins which stand between you and God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;in-remembrance&quot;&gt;In remembrance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luke 22 had the same account of the Lord’s Supper with some additional important details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;Now when the hour came, Jesus took his place at the table and the apostles joined him.  &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;And he said to them, “I have earnestly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer.  &lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;For I tell you, I &lt;strong&gt;will not eat it again until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God&lt;/strong&gt;.”  &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;Then he took a cup, and after giving thanks he said, “Take this and divide it among yourselves.  &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;For I tell you that from now on I &lt;strong&gt;will not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes&lt;/strong&gt;.”  &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;Then he took bread, and after giving thanks he broke it and gave it to them, saying, “This is my body which is given for you. Do this in &lt;strong&gt;remembrance of me&lt;/strong&gt;.”  &lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;And in the same way he took the cup after they had eaten, saying, “This cup that is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood. (Luke 22:14-20)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Old Covenant Passover, the people were reminded year after year of the terrible sufferings they had while in Egypt, and the passing over of the Lord which was but a shadow of the true Passover accomplished for us in Christ. Moreover this is not a type of joyful remembrance as one had hoped for. All the strict rules governing the observance of this event, and what it reminds people of, makes it anything but joyful. The Hebrews verse below puts it so succinctly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But in those sacrifices there is a &lt;strong&gt;reminder of sins&lt;/strong&gt; year after year. (Hebrews 10:3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the Passover that Jesus conducted ushered in a new era of remembrances not of sins but of the Savior, not of unavoidable and repeated human failures but of perfect completion of the Christ who came to fulfill all requirements of the law. How could he do that? The Passover was such an important part of Jewish life, and now He’s telling them to forget it all but remember Him instead? Yes, that was exactly what He said: &lt;em&gt;“Do this in remembrance of me.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And contrary to the Old Passover when sacrifices must be offered repeatedly year after year, Christ observed it once and put an end to it when He went to the cross. One thing that remains to be revealed to us is when He said: &lt;em&gt;“I will not eat it again until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.”&lt;/em&gt; There is much prophetic inference at what Jesus said here, if this is a special Passover that ends all Old Covenant Passovers, what will be the one when the kingdom of God comes? We’ll never know until then, but what we know is it will probably be like the welcoming party for the prodigal son.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;i-am-worthy&quot;&gt;I am worthy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve seen so far that the New Covenant Passover, or the Lord’s Supper, or the Communion as we now know it, is not at all about us, but about the One who came to shed His blood for the sins of the world. Therefore the question that should be raised about the observance of the Lord Supper should be whether the participants understand what it means, whether they know that it’s no longer a ritual, a sacrament, or a religious duty, but a time of joyful reflection upon what a great salvation Christ has achieved for us, unencumbered by forms and strict guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even in the context of 1 Corinthians 11, these folks may have behaved in a manner unworthy of communion participants, they were every bit worthy as anyone to receive the communion wine and bread, because Christ has paid it all for them as well. The erroneous interpretation of 1 Corinthians 11 concerning communion worthiness has caused so many to stumble, instead of coming to the celebration with hearts full of joy in the remembrance of Christ act of redemtion, they dreaded that there might be sins in their lives that might cause the Lord to take them out and kill them. As a matter of fact, upon such reminder of self introspection no one can be certain that they are 100% certain of their worthiness before receiving the communion. This casts a long shadow on an otherwise a joyful event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What will communion participants be reminded of when the worship leader ask them to examine their hearts? Will they be like the Israelites who still lived under the law who remember their sins and trespasses when they were still under slavery in Egypt? Absolutely not. Jesus asked them to &lt;em&gt;“remember me.”&lt;/em&gt; On the one hand is the remembrance of sins, while on the other a remembrance of a deliverance from sins thanks to Christ. Are you still living under the Old Covenant, or are you now relating to God through the New Covenant?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;By calling this covenant “new,” he has made the first one obsolete; and what is obsolete and outdated will soon disappear. (Hebrews 8:13)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
