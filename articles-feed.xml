&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://vacsf.org/assets/images/Obedience-teaser.jpg&quot; style=&quot;border: 1px solid #cccccc; margin: 7px 15px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 148px; padding: 0px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;
There are more than a few dozens of verses in the Bible that contain the word obedience or other forms of it, but none are as well remembered as the refrain of the hymn Trust and Obey. This article aims to show that there are two ways the term is interpreted and applied, one is of the obedience to avoid sins, or to do what is good—this is the most common, and is the type that I call “rudimentary obedience”—, and one of a response to the gospel to enter into a trust relationship with God through Christ—this is rarely taught as an act of obedience as compared to the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;obedience-and-the-law&quot;&gt;Obedience and the law&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though there are many things we should be obedient about, it appears obedience in relation to sins seems to be something people are most concerned with; either by commission or omission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much energy is spent trying to get the flesh under control, to avoid sins as much as possible. But how successful are these efforts through the ages? Are Christians sinning less and less? The amount of material still dedicated to flesh control shows if it isn’t a losing battle, it hasn’t made any progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also obedience cannot exist apart from a certain system of law. The person following certain patterns of obedience must be under some law. It draws a line between obedience and disobedience, it defines what meets a certain criteria and what doesn’t. To a Christian who did not come into the faith from a Jewish system of laws, he may be under a conscience based law (Romans 2:14) that can exacerbate the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This mode of living runs decidedly against what is taught in the Bible that we’re no longer under law but under grace (Romans 6:14), and we have died to the law since Christ died for us (Romans 7:4). Romans 7:6 says it more emphatically that &lt;em&gt;“we have been released from the law”&lt;/em&gt;. And if we follow the thread of reasoning in Romans all the way to Romans 8:12, we’d find that those who measure their standing with God through the law/obedience are actually living according to the flesh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following verse may explain why the law fails in restraining the flesh:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For when we were in the flesh, the &lt;strong&gt;sinful desires, aroused by the law&lt;/strong&gt;, were active in the members of our body to bear fruit for death. (Romans 7:5)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a time when obedience/law was required to lead us to Christ. The Bible describes us during this time as little children whose guardian, or schoolmaster, is the law who we must obey until we come to Christ. The problem as we have seen is the overwhelming majority of Christians still insists on living under the law, or the obedience to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-obedience-which-is-faith&quot;&gt;The Obedience which is Faith&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However there is a much better obedience, one that is not powered by the law, but by grace through faith. It doesn’t require useless efforts of the flesh, but it requires rest. A rest freely given to those who comes to Christ to trust in His proclamation: &lt;em&gt;“It’s finished!”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Calvinists and Armenians believe that the only people who can make it to the kingdom of God are those who persevere, or be obedient, all the way to the end of their lives. Their obedience is based on compliance to the law. Not the obedience proposed by this article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article proposes that the very faith in the finished work of Christ is itself the obedience that Christ came to die for. This obedience is expressed in the following two verses:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;. . . through whom we have received grace and apostleship for &lt;strong&gt;obedience to the faith&lt;/strong&gt; among all nations for His name. (Romans 1:5 —NKJV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;. . . and by the prophetic Scriptures [the mystery] has been made known to all nations, according to the commandment of the everlasting God, for &lt;strong&gt;obedience to the faith&lt;/strong&gt;. (Romans 16:26 — NKJV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s also consider these verses that help us see that to obey God is to believe in the one He’s sent: Acts 6:7, Romans 10:16, 2 Thessalonians 1:8, John 3:36, John 6:28-29, 1 Peter 1:2, 1 Peter 1:22, 1 Peter 2:7-8, and Acts 5:32 (please go &lt;a href=&quot;https://faithalone.org/magazine/y1993/93july3.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for a great explanation of the &lt;em&gt;“obedience which is faith”&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who do you believe, the Calvinists/Armenians or the Bible? John 3:16 puts it very simply, and powerfully, directly from the mouth of God: &lt;em&gt;“For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that &lt;strong&gt;whosoever&lt;/strong&gt; believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life (KJV).”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the obedience that pleases God. This is the obedience that works. And this alone is the obedience that takes you to heaven. The other obedience may actually make you fall from grace because all will have failed it all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it. &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life, and only a few find it (Matthew 7:13-14).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://vacsf.org/assets/images/The_narrow_way-teaser.jpg&quot; style=&quot;border: 1px solid #cccccc; margin: 7px 15px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 148px; padding: 0px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;
According to most common interpretations, the narrow gate, or path, denotes troubles and challenges awaiting those who choose to embark on it. However there is curiously a paradoxical expectation that the life of a good Christian is filled with God’s blessings, especially material blessings, great financial rewards and a vibrant family life; a projection of God’s goodness to those who belong to Him as a testimony to the unbelieving world. But there is nothing in the immediate context of these verses that warrants such interpretations, of promises of either difficulties or smooth sailings. Yet this is what one often hears from pulpits everywhere across the entire spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;common-interpretationscontradictions&quot;&gt;Common interpretations/contradictions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sufferings&quot;&gt;Sufferings&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In accordance with common interpretations, one is warned of a hard life that is expected of those who follow Christ. We were warned of persecutions from the enemies of the cross, we were advised to be ready to make many sacrifices, to forsake any thoughts of a comfortable life, or of privileges. And if &lt;em&gt;“the Son of Man has no place to lay his head (Luke 9:58)”&lt;/em&gt; who are we to expect any better? Suffering seems to be the underlying theme in most if not all sermons, and virtually all religions of the world as well. Some price has to be paid, some work has to be performed so there might be gain, and since there cannot be something that comes from nothing, so it is with salvation, there must be some suffering as a prerequisite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;blessings&quot;&gt;Blessings&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly in the same Sunday worship service, folks are encouraged to share their blessings. The more the blessings, the more proofs of their being right with God. Blessings such as successful children, healing of diseases, jobs found, babies born, protection from a near fatal automobile accident, miraculous divine intervention, answered prayers, and myriad accounts that validate one’s good standing with God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-contradictions&quot;&gt;The contradictions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Has something changed? Do sermons actually prepare folks for a hard life ahead, or do they promise folks of an easy life once they enter the faith? Damned if you do and damned if you don’t. Forget about messages you hear of the virtue of suffering, you feel cursed if your life is filled with adversities. Wasn’t this what happened to Job? Or the assumptions people made of the man blind since birth?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside of the Christian circles, people who share common troubles actually find in their support groups the comfort of knowing they’re not alone, yet within the supposedly loving body of Christ, they feel like outcasts. It’s not that they are actually condemned by their fellow believers, but it is because they feel a condemnation within their own souls due to conflicting messages they’ve heard over the years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-kingdom-of-god&quot;&gt;The Kingdom of God&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without a firm and sound foundation of biblical understanding of how God accepts and saves them, the believers base their relationship with God entirely on their circumstances. Instead of rejoicing in their adversities, they engage in morbid introspection to try to figure out what they’ve done wrong, whether they’ve failed God somehow. Instead of treading lightly while receiving God’s blessings with open hands, knowing deep in their hearts that it was due to God’s grace and mercies toward them, they either brag or judge those who are going through difficulties. The book of Job and the story of the man blind since birth are demonstrations of this type of thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is the root of the problem. If salvation, or justification, is based on performance, on works, or on personal merit, so it is with everything else. How we approach the kingdom of God will inevitably color the lenses through which we make our evaluations. Matthew 6:33 says &lt;em&gt;“Seek first the Kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things will be added unto you,”&lt;/em&gt; Yet so much bandwidth is dedicated to &lt;em&gt;“all these things,”&lt;/em&gt; where all these things include supposedly noble endeavors such as ministries, evangelism, prayers, Bible studies, giving to the poor, parenting, overcoming addictions, peer pressure, and tons of other how-tos. But as good as &lt;em&gt;“all these things”&lt;/em&gt; are, they’re not part of the Kingdom of God and His righteousness, they’re still on this side of eternity. As a matter of fact, the Lord had revealed to Isaiah that they’re but &lt;em&gt;“filthy rags.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who can really know the true meaning of the Kingdom of God and His righteousness? The only people who know what the Kingdom of God is like are those who have entered it; the rest are people on the outside speculating about things they do not know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;gods-righteousness&quot;&gt;God’s righteousness&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only people who can enter the Kingdom of God are those who are deemed righteous by God. And yet it’s not their own righteousness, but the righteousness of God that is bestowed on them. And how is it bestowed on them? Not by works, but by faith. Since it’s entirely by God’s grace and mercies upon them that they enjoy this righteousness, they don’t have to wait; God has already called Himself their Father and them His children. Since their heavenly inheritance is not at all dependent on them, but on the finished work of Christ, they have become alive again like when God gave the Holy Spirit to mankind at the beginning of creation. These people are already inside the Kingdom of God. They know what they’re talking about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who are still outside? These are the people who depend on the works of the law to make their faith perfect. What the law does is it reminds them of their sins. It creates a formidable barrier between them and God because:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For no one can ever be made right with God by doing what the law commands. The law simply shows us how sinful we are.
(Romans 3:20 — NLT)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their works are never over. The law instead of giving them the righteousness they need to enter God’s kingdom, it drives them further from God because it magnifies their sins like the giants in the promised land. Therefore by definition those who depend on the works of the law cannot possibly know God or His kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;narrow-vs-broad&quot;&gt;Narrow vs. broad&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God allows no means of access to Him other than His own provision: Jesus Christ. He said this in John 14:6:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world has always tried to access God through their own efforts, through works of various laws, but Jesus shows them a very narrow path: trusting in the finished work of Christ. That’s how narrow it is. It’s not narrow because of troubles or difficulties, but because of how God defines it. For those who depend on their works, the path is broad in the sense that each one is on their own lane, each one defines their own way how to access God, because each person’s work is different from another’s. It’s a broad path with infinite opportunities to get lost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;deadly-misinterpretation&quot;&gt;Deadly misinterpretation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By defining the narrow path as a difficult road, people change its meaning from grace to works, from the singular trust in Christ to the myriad possibilities of man’s efforts, from the assurance of salvation to the uncertainty of random choices to meet arbitrary man-made standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The true narrow path is in fact the easiest one as it is straight and narrow with no deviations or detours, it leads straight from captivities to the promised land. On it, God takes us home on &lt;a href=&quot;http://vacsf.org/articles/Exodus-19-04-25/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;wings of eagles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (Exodus 19:4).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However this narrow path may prove difficult to those who walk by the flesh—keep in mind that it is not about falling into sinful temptations, but about using fleshly efforts to draw near to God—. As this article attempts to show that the difficulties lie not in trying circumstances, but in the choice that one makes. Those who rely on the law, or the works of it, or the obedience of the flesh, have much to lose like the rich young ruler who met Jesus in Matthew 19:16-22. Without works as their trophies they cannot boast from their self righteousness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great accountability lies with the handlers of Scriptures. How have you interpreted biblical concepts such as “the narrow path” to those who sit under your pulpits? Are you helping folks to, or preventing them from, entering the Kingdom of God?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/nav&gt;
--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two passages in the Bible that appear to be in direct conflict with each other: Romans 3:23-28, with verse 28 which says &lt;em&gt;“One is justified by faith apart from works of the law,”&lt;/em&gt; and James 2:20-26, with verse 24 which says &lt;em&gt;“You see that a person is justified by works and not by faith alone.”&lt;/em&gt;. How do we reconcile these apparent differences?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-two-opposing-views-of-justification&quot;&gt;The two opposing views of justification&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;border: 1px solid #cccccc; margin: 7px 15px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 300px; padding: 0px; float: left;&quot; src=&quot;http://vacsf.org/assets/images/Faith-Salvation-Works circle.png&quot; alt=&quot;Salvation by faith alone, or faith plus works?&quot; /&gt;
The majority of Christians try to resolve this conflict by citing James 2:22 which says &lt;em&gt;“You see that faith was active along with his works, and faith was completed by his works,”&lt;/em&gt; and the traditional explanation is: what James is really saying is as a person comes to faith in Christ there will be changes in his life that produce good works. This is a reasonable explanation, but is this what James is really saying? Or what he’s really saying is if a person is not performing works of God, not obedience to the law of Moses after they come to the Lord Jesus by faith, then they are not saved at all, and what James is advocating is salvation is completely by works with faith thrown in for good measure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conversely Paul says &lt;em&gt;“And we have come to believe in Christ Jesus, so that we may be justified through faith in Christ and not by the works of the law, because by the works of the law no one will be justified. (&lt;u&gt;Galatians 2:16&lt;/u&gt;)”&lt;/em&gt; There are though many more instances in Scriptures that show their differences, and more importantly they are not trivial. The true meaning of the path that is narrow is not that those who travel on it must endure many trials and tribulations, but it is as narrow as being a very strict definition of how one can reconcile with God. The theology set forth by both Paul and James are different enough they cannot fit on this narrow path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us consider a strong possibility that James does not agree with Paul, and vice versa. As a matter of fact, a discovery of their differences and disagreements actually helps in showing that the Scriptures is consistent in its message of salvation. On the other hand, an effort to reconcile them actually brings a negative effect: one Bible shows two conflicting paths toward salvation. But before we delve into the analysis of their differences and disagreements, let’s review what salvation is, as a frame of reference for our studies of both arguments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-our-standing-before-god&quot;&gt;What is our standing before God?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is our current position before God? What does God see in us? Does He see Christ’s righteousness in us, or does He hold our sins against us? If He still holds our sins against us then we’re not fully justified, then there must be some changes in our lives so that we sin less and less, at least less enough to whatever degree that might be, so that God accepts us. This is generally the point of view of the majority of Christians, that we must use our works to maintain our relationship with God, and then perhaps we’ll be rewarded in proportion to the amount of good works we’ve done while in the flesh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t subscribe to this view at all. Not because it’s a philosophy that I hold, or it’s something that I feel, but because there are enough points of reference scattered throughout Scriptures to show not only that we’re saved by God’s grace, but we’re to live the remainder of our lives by that grace as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-salvation&quot;&gt;What is salvation?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a good news, a solution to a problem. But what is the problem? The problem started in the Garden of Eden when man expressed their desire to be independent from God, to possess the knowledge of good and evil, of right and of wrong, like God. Now they would know what to do and what not to do, to function independently from God. But this independence came at a great cost: they began to die, first spiritually then physical death ensued.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, and in this way death came to all people, because all sinned. (Romans 5:12)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God provided a solution to this sin and death problem by sending His Son Jesus Christ to take away the world’s sins on the cross,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;God was reconciling the world to himself in Christ, not counting people’s sins against them. (2 Corinthians 5:19)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and when Jesus came back from the dead he gave the Holy Spirit to man as a free gift. He gave back the life of God that had been lost in Adam. What is even more important is there will be no sins left unforgiven that would cause that life to leave, and the life that we now have is &lt;strong&gt;eternal life&lt;/strong&gt;, everlasting life, something that we experience now and will carry us on until eternity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the gospel. The good news is the solution to the problem. The problem is sin and death, and the solution is the forgiveness of sin and the restoration of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. &lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;Much more then, having now been justified by His blood, we shall be saved from the wrath of God through Him. &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved by His life. (Romans 5:8-10)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this is indeed the gospel, the definition of our salvation, then we are righteous, holy, and justified before our God, not because of what we have done, but because of what He did for us, because of His grace and mercies. This is of critical importance to understand because without this understanding, it’s easy for someone to believe that the work of God was not truly complete on the cross, so even though He’d died on the cross, and rose from the dead, there was so much left undone, so it’s up to you now to complete. Believe it or not, this is the teaching of most, if not all, major denominations in the world right now though their statement of faith says they believe in justification by grace alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;do-you-have-enough-works&quot;&gt;Do you have enough works?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are among those who believe you must to have works to add to your faith, how do you know you will have done enough before you meet God? Will you be able to get all the sins out of your life? How much witnessing do you have to do to be considered fruitful? Who will define for you what is an adequate amount of works? And when will you know you’ve done enough? The answer is easy, you’ll never know when, or how much, you’ve done enough, until you meet the Lord and He will tell you of your performance. Perhaps the parable of the talents apply here. If your belief demands works, you will have to return to God exactly the double amount of talents that He gave you. And still that may not be enough, you will find out whether the quality of your works will be acceptable to Him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This must be the reason why virtually all folks who are under the justification by faith plus works will invariably answer the question of their salvation like this: I will just try my best and hope for the best. That is a very sad way of living that amounts to almost a superstition, a worship of idols whose minds no one can know. In this mode of living, you’ll never be at peace with your God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there is no evidence in the Scriptures that this is how one should relate to God. What is evident is Jesus died on the cross to make you perfectly acceptable to God now and forevermore. Your salvation is based on Him, and sustained by your faith, and not on your “filthy rags” works at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;By his will we have been made holy through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all. (Hebrews 10:10)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, if your salvation is based on works, your works must be performed to perfection. Jesus said “Be perfect, for your Father in heaven is perfect” (Matthew 5:48). Of course this was what He said to those who were under the law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;galatians-2-paul-visits-jerusalem&quot;&gt;Galatians 2: Paul visits Jerusalem&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Then after fourteen years I went up to Jerusalem again with Barnabas, taking Titus along too.  &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;I went there because of a revelation and presented  to them the gospel that I preach among the Gentiles. But I did so only in a private meeting with the influential people, to make sure that I was not running - or had not run - in vain.  &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Yet not even Titus, who was with me, was compelled to be circumcised, although he was a Greek.  &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;Now this matter arose because of the false brothers with false pretenses who slipped in unnoticed to spy on our freedom that we have in Christ Jesus, to make us slaves.  &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;But we did not surrender to them even for a moment, in order that the truth of the gospel would remain with you. (Galatians 2:1-5)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul went up to the church in Jerusalem to present to them the gospel that he preached among the Gentiles, which was different from, and in direct conflict with, what was being preached by the apostles. Paul only did this with the influential people because the differences must be significant enough to potentially cause problems had it been presented to the entire congregation and put them in a difficult situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were people at this church whom Paul called “false brothers” who spied on Paul and Titus, trying to find faults with their freedom. Their intention was to put them again under the bondage of the law, but Paul did not yield at all. He kept Titus from being forced to undergo circumcision in compliance with the Old Covenant laws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had Paul allowed Titus to be circumcised, he would have been sending conflicting messages concerning the gospel. To the Galatians church, he taught that justification is by faith alone, but allowing Titus, a Gentile, to be circumcised would implicate that justification is by faith plus works. In other words, all his effort to teach them the truth of the gospel would have been in vain, but his being unyielding to the lawkeepers allowed the truth of the gospel to remain with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Acts 15 there is a historical record, given by Luke, which explains further the reason for Paul’s trip. Let us take a detour to this Acts passage to get a fuller context before we return to chapter 2 of Galatians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;acts-15-historical-record-of-the-visit&quot;&gt;Acts 15: Historical record of the visit&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Now some men came down from Judea and began to teach the brothers, “Unless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved.”  &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;When Paul and Barnabas had a major argument and debate with them, the church appointed Paul and Barnabas and some others from among them to go up to meet with the apostles and elders in Jerusalem about this point of disagreement. …  &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;But some from the religious party of the Pharisees who had believed stood up and said, “It is necessary to circumcise the Gentiles and to order them to observe the law of Moses.” (Acts 15:1-5)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul travelled to Jerusalem to meet with the church’s leaders including Peter and James who is the head of the church there. The important thing when we read the passage above is we must pay attention to differences or disagreements between Paul and the leaders as reported by Dr. Luke. These differences are not matters of styles or preferences, but of critical importance in relation to justification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were people from Judea who sincerely believe that unless the believers, Jews or Gentiles alike, are circumcised and obedient to the law of Moses, their salvation is in peril. A major debate broke out between Paul and Barnabas againts those who advocate the keeping of the law of Moses. In order to resolve the conflict, the church appointed Paul and Barnabas to go to Jerusalem to discuss the matter with the church’s leaders. The core issue in the debate is: is justification by faith alone, or is it by faith and works—being circumcised and obedient to the law of Moses?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is the first time here at chapter 15 that they began to debate the matter of justification. As a matter of fact, it wasn’t until chapter 11 that they began to acknowledge that the Gentiles could be saved, therefore it goes without saying that from chapter 1 through 10, salvation for the Gentiles was completely excluded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-meeting-with-the-apostles-and-elders&quot;&gt;The meeting with the apostles and elders&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;Both the apostles and the elders met together to deliberate about this matter.  &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;After there had been much debate, Peter stood up and said to them, “Brothers, you know that some time ago God chose me to preach to the Gentiles so they would hear the message of the gospel and believe.  &lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;And God, who knows the heart, has testified to them by giving them the Holy Spirit just as he did to us,  &lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;and he made no distinction between them and us, cleansing their hearts by faith.  &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;So now why are you putting God to the test by placing on the neck of the disciples a yoke that neither our ancestors nor we have been able to bear?  &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;On the contrary, we believe that we are saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus, in the same way as they are.” (Acts 15:6-11)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this meeting, we saw that Peter affirmed Paul’s messages to the Gentiles that their salvation is not conditioned upon their keeping of the law of Moses. That the cleansing of the believers’ hearts was by faith—not by works. Peter was bold to acknowledge that neither they nor their ancestors were able to bear the weight of the law, so there is no reason why they should impose such condition upon the Gentiles. And ultimately, why would God give the Holy Spirit to someone who is not fully acceptable to Him?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;james-resolution-didnt-go-far-enough&quot;&gt;James’ resolution didn’t go far enough&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After much discussion and listening to points of view of Paul, Barnabas, and other apostles and elders, James decided to resolve the dispute by asking others to stop bothering the Gentiles, but just write letters to tell them to &lt;em&gt;“abstain from things defiled by idols and from sexual immorality and from what has been strangled and from blood (Acts 15:20).”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James refrained from enforcing the whole law, but he left enough of what amounted to being the “yeast of the Pharisees.” James did not go as far as saying that the Gentiles do not have to be circumcised. He did not even mention circumcision which was the key issue in the debate. In skirting the issue, James implicitly stated that his stand on justification was that it was based on faith perfected by the keeping of all of Mosaic laws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James showed his hypocrisy when he tried to impose the keeping of the laws on the Gentiles that neither he nor his ancestors ever could. But the key point to take away from here is this shows a profound disagreement between him and Paul. And you have to decide who is more in line with Scriptures and choose one, because they’re definitely incompatible. So incompatible to the point that Paul wrote this in Galatians:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You who are trying to be justified by the law have been alienated from Christ; you have fallen away from grace. (Galatians 5:4)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope by now you stop trying to reconcile James and Paul, or rather you should stop trying to say that James’ teaching is full of grace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;james-gospel-impossible-for-salvation&quot;&gt;James’ gospel: impossible for salvation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gospel according to James is impossible to live by. His insistence on a faith that requires the keeping of Mosaic laws makes it so. In verse 1 of chapter 15 above, James was recorded as saying this: &lt;em&gt;“Unless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved. (Acts 15:1)”&lt;/em&gt;, but Paul emphasized the implication of lawkeeping with this: &lt;em&gt;“Again I declare to every man who lets himself be circumcised that he is obligated to obey the whole law. (Galatians 5:3)”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s us not forget that no one ever could keep the entire law: &lt;em&gt;“why are you putting God to the test by placing on the neck of the disciples a yoke that neither our ancestors nor we have been able to bear? (Acts 15:10)”&lt;/em&gt;. Additionally, if you insist on keeping the law to get right with God, you have to fulfill at least two of these requirements: 1) &lt;em&gt;“Be perfect, as your father in heaven is perfect” (Matthew 5:48)&lt;/em&gt;, and 2) &lt;em&gt;“Unless your righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law, you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven. (Matthew 5:20)”&lt;/em&gt; Keep in mind that Jesus said these things only to those who tried to get right with God through their own self righteousness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;galatians-2-revisited&quot;&gt;Galatians 2 revisited&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;But from those who were influential (whatever they were makes no difference to me; God shows no favoritism between people) - those influential leaders added nothing to my message.  &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;On the contrary, when they saw that I was entrusted with the gospel to the uncircumcised just as Peter was to the circumcised  &lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;(for he who empowered Peter for his apostleship to the circumcised also empowered me for my apostleship to the Gentiles)  &lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;and when James, Cephas, and John, who had a reputation as pillars, recognized the grace that had been given to me, they gave to Barnabas and me the right hand of fellowship, agreeing that we would go to the Gentiles and they to the circumcised.  &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;They requested only that we remember the poor, the very thing I also was eager to do.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;But when Cephas came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face, because he had clearly done wrong.  &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;Until certain people came from James, he had been eating with the Gentiles. But when they arrived, he stopped doing this and separated himself because he was afraid of those who were pro-circumcision.  &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;And the rest of the Jews also joined with him in this hypocrisy, so that even Barnabas was led astray with them by their hypocrisy.  &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;But when I saw that they were not behaving consistently with the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas in front of them all, “If you, although you are a Jew, live like a Gentile and not like a Jew, how can you try to force the Gentiles to live like Jews “
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;We are Jews by birth and not Gentile sinners,  &lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;yet we know that no one is justified by the works of the law but by the faithfulness of Jesus Christ. And we have come to believe in Christ Jesus, so that we may be justified by the faithfulness of Christ and not by the works of the law, because by the works of the law no one will be justified.
(Galatians 2:6-16)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we’re still in the same context with Acts 15, where the apostle Paul and Barnabas went to Jerusalem to meet with the apostles and leaders to discuss why they they wanted to impose Mosaic laws on believers, both Jews and Gentiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting at verse 6, Paul declared that &lt;em&gt;“those influential leaders add nothing to my message,”&lt;/em&gt; and he called them out, James, Cephas (Peter), and John. What Paul said amounted to this: justification is by faith alone, therefore whatever James and other apostles were teaching can be disregarded without any danger to one’s salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later in Galatians Paul was much more firm in expressing his disagreement: &lt;em&gt;“Mark my words! I, Paul, tell you that if you let yourselves be circumcised, Christ will be of no value to you at all (Galatians 5:2).”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this same passage we also notice an incident involving Peter that shows Paul’s disagreement with other apostles. It was when Peter showed his hypocrisy by quickly distancing himself from the Gentiles believers when he saw James’ pro-circumcision people arriving on the scene. Even Barnabas was vulnerable to the pressure from James’ influence. When in Jerusalem, Paul was restraint in expressing his disagreement, but here in Antioch, the Gentile world, he made it known in the face of Peter and the believers, those that Paul worked so hard to keep their faith pure, that their behavior was inconsistent with the gospel. Paul had to go all out to let everyone know the serious incompatibility between the two systems of salvation: justification by faith, and justification by faith plus works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here it was in Acts 15, many years after Christ rose again the church debated for the first time whether salvation was by faith alone. We often make the mistake of thinking that all of the Bible is always about good things to learn and apply. No, this is not true at all. It records good things that we can learn from and bad things that we should avoid, good theology that is consistent with the whole of Scriptures and bad theology that even apostles embraced despite their years spent with their Lord.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here Paul made it clear that his gospel applies to both Jews and Gentiles alike when he said: &lt;em&gt;“&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;We are Jews by birth and not Gentile sinners,  &lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;yet we know that no one is justified by the works of the law but by faith in Jesus Christ.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-differences-are-clear&quot;&gt;The differences are clear&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;james-justification&quot;&gt;James’ justification&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You see that faith was active along with his works, and faith was completed by his work (James 2:22)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;pauls-justification&quot;&gt;Paul’s justification&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And we have come to believe in Christ Jesus, so that we may be justified by the faithfulness of Christ and not by the works of the law, because by the works of the law no one will be justified. (Galatians 2:16)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;youre-fully-accepted-by-god&quot;&gt;You’re fully accepted by God&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In James’ version of justification, though you may be saved through faith, you’re not yet perfect, or rather your faith is not yet perfect until a certain amount of works is added to bring that faith to completion. God loves you but He hasn’t fully accepted you yet. There’s more work to do before you become more holy, more sanctified, &lt;a href=&quot;http://vacsf.org/articles/Immitation-of-Christ/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;becoming more like Christ&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. As already discussed earlier, since you cannot meet God without being perfect, when will you be perfect enough to meet God according to James?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand if justification is entirely by faith, you will know without any doubt your place in the heart of God and His kingdom. Because your perfection is not based on you, but on Christ, and in Him God has given all you need to stand against that day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;Once you were alienated from God and were enemies in your minds because of your evil behavior. &lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;But now he has reconciled you by Christ’s physical body through death to present you holy in his sight, without blemish and free from accusation— &lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;if you continue in your faith, established and firm, and do not move from the hope held out in the gospel. This is the gospel that you heard and that has been proclaimed to every creature under heaven, and of which I, Paul, have become a servant. (Colossians 1:21-23)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, indeed, in Christ you have been made perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;credit&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote an article on this same topic several years ago when the reality of God’s grace began to grow in my heart. I titled it “Faith, Salvation, and Works—the Cycle of Frustration.” In that first writing I tried very hard to reconcile James with Paul. I was looking for grace, pure grace, in James’ writing but the book of James had become a dark side of God that made me afraid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Praise God that I found in the radio archive of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newcovenantinstitute.net/living_god_ministries/radio_archive/faith_works.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Living God Ministries&lt;/a&gt; a series of four broadcasts on Faith and Works that answered my nagging question whether there is a fine print under John 3:16. Just after listening to the introduction of the series where brother Aaron Budjen talked about the proven disagreements between James and Paul, I knew this was what I had been looking for, that there are apostles that are preaching another gospel. I didn’t dare to think this not too long ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article is very much based on Aaron’s messages with occasional injection of my own thoughts. However the thoughts expressed in this writing do not necessarily reflect Aaron’s theology or beliefs, I might have misinterpreted or misunderstood some points from the original messages, but I hope to communicate as closely as possible what Aaron wanted to convey to the listeners. For a much more complete explanation of this topic please click on the link above to access the audio files of this radio series. Eternally grateful, brother Aaron.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Most people cite Galatians 6:2 as the definition for the new law of Christ: &lt;em&gt;“Carry one another’s burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ.”&lt;/em&gt; Some also cite the gospel verses, such as Matthew 12:30-31, where Jesus gave a new commandment as the new law of Christ: &lt;em&gt;“&lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt;Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength.’ &lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;The second is: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’ There is no other commandment greater than these.”&lt;/em&gt; This article will show why a simplistic interpretation and application of the law of Christ, specifically in the context of Galatians 6:2, is not in accordance with the intended meaning in Scriptures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-purpose-of-the-law&quot;&gt;The purpose of the law&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://vacsf.org/assets/images/law-of-christ-teaser.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 1px solid #cccccc; margin: 7px 15px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 148px; padding: 0px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;
The very first set of law governed mankind even before they received the Ten Commandments from mount Sinai. It began to inhabit their conscience in the form of the knowledge of good and evil after they ate of the forbidden fruit. But whether it’s conscience-based law or the Ten Commandments, they served one purpose: &lt;em&gt;“&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;The law had become our guardian until Christ, so that we could be declared righteous by faith. &lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt;But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a guardian. &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;For in Christ Jesus you are all sons of God through faith.”&lt;/em&gt; (Galatians 3:24-26)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;jesus-love-commandment&quot;&gt;Jesus’ love commandment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now things get interesting when we come to the New Testament, specifically at the four gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. Most folks automatically assume that the New Covenant, not New Testament, is introduced at the arrival of Jesus, but this is not true. The entire period before the crucifixion and death of Jesus actually signifies the end of the Old Covenant, and the New Covenant would not come into effect until Jesus’ resurrection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore the whole earthly lifespan of Jesus from birth to death is the transition between the Covenants. During this time many things Jesus spoke of must be understood from the Old Covenant context, while others were about things under the New Covenant that was still to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In its appropriate context, Jesus’s pronouncement of the new commandment in Matthew 22:37-39: &lt;em&gt;“&lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt;Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength.’ &lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;The second is: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’ There is no other commandment greater than these”&lt;/em&gt; must be understood as one that encompasses the Ten Commandments and more, and it is still one that is fundamentally a condition of the Old Covenant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this time, virtually all Israelites lived by the Mosaic laws along with the Ten Commandments. They governed all areas of their lives. Let us do a comparison between the Ten Commandments and Jesus’ new love command. From Paul’s epistles we learn that the law only served as a teacher to lead us to Christ and it does so by making us conscious of sin, it does not give us the righteousness we need, therefore it cannot give life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Therefore no one will be declared righteous in God’s sight by the works of the law; rather, through the law we become conscious of our sin.” (Romans 3:20)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of the law is either to make us conscious of sin, or to make self-righteous people realize that though they may have tried to observe all aspects of the law, they’re still in sin. For example, in Matthew 5:28 Jesus clarified, or amplified, the sin of adultery when he said this: &lt;em&gt;“But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the same manner of communication, Jesus took the Ten Commandments to a higher level by replacing it with the love commandment, however the intended purpose of this commandment is still the same: to convict man of sin, but not to make them become more acceptable to God. It’s much easier for most to keep the “thou shalt not commit murder” but it’s practically impossible for anyone to keep the commandment of “Love your neighbor as yourself.” If it’s impossible to keep the Ten Commandments, it’s even more so with the love command. The purpose of any law, as expressed through commandments, is to expose sin and to condemn those who fail. The love command is no exception.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus saves, commandments don’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-law-of-christ&quot;&gt;The law of Christ&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However some may ask: What about the law of Christ in Galatians 6:2: &lt;em&gt;“Carry each other’s burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ”&lt;/em&gt;? Some folks believe that now we have a new law, namely the law of Christ that we have to keep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this law of Christ the same thing as those we we cited earlier, the Ten Commandments and the love commandment that superceded it? If it is, then Paul has come full circle to a contradiction with his teaching on the role of the law. Let’s think about it. Who fulfilled the Ten Commandments? Jesus did, and in doing so he satisfied all the requirements of the law so those who believed in Him may be counted as righteous. Those laws had to do with salvation, not that they can save us, but they served as a schoolmaster, or teacher, to lead us to Christ. Now that we’re already in Christ, what role does this law play in a Christian’s life?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note the verses leading to Galatians 6:2:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Brothers and sisters, if a person is discovered in some sin, you who are spiritual restore such a person in a spirit of gentleness. Pay close attention to yourselves, so that you are not tempted too. (Galatians 6:1)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that Paul addresses the audience here as brothers and sisters, not as unbelievers, therefore the law of Christ in this context is not the same as those that went before. Then he talks about someone who is discovered in some sin, and asks us to restore them. Immediately following that is talk of burdens in the same context. We must ask ourselves what burden can it be but the burden of sin and guilt?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people take it to mean a general burden of living, but in this context it can only be a burden of sin and guilt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Romans 8:1-2, Paul talks about the law of the spirit of life:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Therefore there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;For in Christ Jesus the law of the Spirit of life has set you free from the law of sin and death. (Romans 8:1-2)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The law of sin and death is just what its name suggests, it condemns people for the sins they commit, but much more than that, it condemns them for their sin nature whether they have committed any sins or not (Romans 5:12). The law of the spirit of life is different, it gives life, it does not contain any commandments that cause man to fail and die upon their failure. It is stated here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life, but whoever rejects the Son will not see life, for God’s wrath remains on them. (John 3:36)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This law must be the law of Christ, it gives life. Then perhaps, the sinful man’s burden can be lifted upon a reminder of this law of the spirit of life to his broken spirit? Perhaps knowing that God has not forsaken him might help set him free from the sin that pulls him down in the first place? When we do this, use the law of Christ, in its true intended purpose, to take away the load of sin and guilt from the sinner, we will have fulfilled it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.” (Matthew 11:28)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one can carry his own burden of sin, let alone carrying this kind of burden for others. Christ alone can, and He has promised to give rest to all those who come to Him.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;CHAPTER I&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Of the imitation of Christ, and of contempt of the world and all its vanities&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
1. He that follows me shall not walk in darkness, says the Lord. There are the words of Christ; and they teach us how far we must imitate His life and character, if we seek true illumination, and deliverance from all blindness of heart. Let it be our most earnest study, therefore, to dwell upon the life of Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Above is an excerpt from The Imitation of Christ by Thomas A. Kempis, the first paragraph of chapter 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;an-assumption-about-jesus&quot;&gt;An assumption about Jesus&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://vacsf.org/assets/images/Imitating-Christ-teaser.jpg&quot; style=&quot;border: 1px solid #cccccc; margin: 7px 15px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 148px; padding: 0px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;
 “Christ teaches us how far we must imitate His life and character,” asserts the author of Imitation of Christ. The author assumes that we can imitate Jesus, and it appears quite a few folks agree with him. But as far as my study of Scriptures has brought me, the idea of imitating Jesus, or him being an example, goes against the biblical message as a whole. I was motivated to write this article after reading an introduction to the gospel of Matthew from a new Vietnamese translation, in which the author, or authors, referred to Jesus as the supreme teacher who had the authority to interprete God’s Law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;who-do-you-say-jesus-is&quot;&gt;Who do you say Jesus is?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People during Jesus’ time thought of him as a teacher. He performed miracles, turned water into wine, claimed to be the Son of God, but ultimately He was their teacher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Matthew 19:16-22, a rich young man came to see Jesus asking Him this: &lt;em&gt;“Good &lt;strong&gt;Teacher&lt;/strong&gt;, what &lt;strong&gt;good&lt;/strong&gt; thing shall I &lt;strong&gt;do&lt;/strong&gt; that I may have eternal life?”&lt;/em&gt; This young man’s question succinctly represents the world’s view of Jesus considering the bolded words in his question. Obviously he considered Jesus a teacher who tells him what good things he must do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In John 3, we read of Nicodemus, a member of the Jewish ruling council, who came to meet Jesus one night saying: &lt;em&gt;“Rabbi, we know that you are a &lt;strong&gt;teacher&lt;/strong&gt; who has come from God. For no one could perform the miraculous signs that you do unless God is with him.”&lt;/em&gt; And Jesus responded with: &lt;em&gt;“I tell you the solemn truth, unless a person is born from above, he cannot see the kingdom of God.”&lt;/em&gt; Nicodemus had a hard time getting the meaning of being born from above because he could only see it from the eyes of the flesh. Much like the young man in the earlier story, he saw Jesus as a teacher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In both these stories, there were nothing Jesus could teach them that they could do. Could the young man truly fulfill any of the commandments even if Jesus showed him how? Case in point is his love for his treasured possessions violates the very commandment of loving the Lord his God with all his heart. Could Nicodemus obey, or try to imitate Jesus, to “be born from above?” Not a chance. It took the universe forming creative power of God to perform such feat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For each descendant of Eve, the sin nature manifests itself in a different way. The bottom line is there is nothing Jesus can teach us, and nothing we can learn from him, to rid ourselves of this nature that had fallen short of God’s glory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In John 6 we read that after Jesus performed the miracle of turning a few fish and loaves of bread into enough food for five thousand people, and of walking on water, they asked him: &lt;em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt;‘What must we do to accomplish the deeds God requires?’’ &lt;sup&gt;29&lt;/sup&gt;Jesus replied, ‘This is the deed God requires - to believe in the one whom he sent.’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like Nicodemus and the rich young ruler, the people immediately think of their flesh as a means to carry out what they think is God’s work. They wanted the teacher to tell them what to do, God said He only wanted them to believe in the one He had sent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;teacher-vs-savior-and-lord&quot;&gt;Teacher vs. Savior and Lord&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the gospel of Matthew we read that one day Jesus asked His disciples who they thought he was, they answered: &lt;em&gt;“Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, Jeremiah or one of the prophets (Matthew 16:14).”&lt;/em&gt; Then He asked them directly who they thought He was, and Peter answered: &lt;em&gt;“You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God (Matthew 16:16).”&lt;/em&gt; Jesus uses Peter’s answer to confirm his role not as a prophet,or any human at any capacity, but as Savior and Lord: &lt;em&gt;“Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah, for this was not revealed to you by flesh and blood, but by my Father in heaven (Matthew 16:17).”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the viewpoint of the flesh, Jesus is a human in various capacities: teacher, prophet, healer, etc., but from a divine revelation, He’s Savior and Lord.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;assuming-jesus-is-a-teacher&quot;&gt;Assuming Jesus is a teacher&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the sake of argument, let’s assume that Jesus came to be our teacher. What might he be teaching us? All the things pertaining to human relationships? Not at all, but only what pertains to the righteousness that restores us the right to become children of God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What could he teach us concerning the righteousness we needed that required His death on the cross? He performed miracles to authenticate his being sent by the Father—can this be imitated? He was born without sin, lived above sin, and died as an unblemished Lamb of God to take away our sin—can this be duplicated? He forgave sins past, present, and future of all of mankind—Imitate this? He raised people from the dead—Anyone? He is Almighty God—Dare you try this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However someone might raise an objection that there were plenty we could learn from Him on this side of eternity, such as humility, self denial, long suffering, and many qualities espoused in books through the ages. Kempis’ book Imitation of Christ is one such book. But except for some who are outside the norm, most folks appear to be socially and morally functional and they already possess the knowledge of these fine qualities expressed in Kempis’ book as well as many other sources. The Son of God didn’t need to leave heaven to teach us these basic principles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Man already had the ability to tell good from evil since the Garden of Eden (Romans 2:14). For the Jews, God spelled it out on tablets of stone. The problem isn’t that mankind needs to be taught anything that they couldn’t have learned already, it’s that though they knew all these things, they simply couldn’t do it. The apostle Paul expressed this dilemma in the following verse:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;We know that the Law is spiritual; but I am unspiritual, sold as a slave to sin. &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;I do not understand what I do. For what I want to do, I do not do. But what I hate, I do (Romans 7:14-15).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then shortly later Paul concludes with this observation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Thanks be to God, who delivers me through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, I myself in my mind am a slave to God’s law, but in my sinful nature a slave to the law of sin (Romans 7:25)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we carefully follow Paul’s line of reasoning we’d find that though Christ is the solution to the perpetual struggle, in setting us free from the guilt of sins, there exists the reality of the sin nature that is a slave to the law of sin, and this will continue as long as we’re still in this corruptible state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;these-books-point-us-in-the-wrong-direction&quot;&gt;These books point us in the wrong direction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s survey another nugget of gold from Kempis’ book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is vanity then to seek after, and to trust in, the riches that shall perish. It is vanity, too, to covet honors, and to lift up ourselves on high. It is vanity to follow the desires of the flesh and be led by them, for this shall bring misery at the last. It is vanity to desire a long life, and to have little care for a good life. It is vanity to take thought only for the life which now is, and not to look forward to the things which shall be hereafter. It is vanity to love that which quickly passes away, and not to hasten where eternal joy abides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doesn’t it feel like a cross between Proverbs and Ecclesiastes? All this wisdom is already there in the pages of Scriptures, but again the problem is “what I want to do, I do not do.” As I recalled my earlier years in the Christian faith, I took in every thought in Imitation wholeheartedly, but the problem was I couldn’t put my finger on anything that would nudge me up one notch in the spirituality ladder. It felt like when I was sitting in a class that gave voice lessons and after hours had gone by, there was no breakthrough, I still couldn’t get that elusive high note.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Books like this gives the reader an illusion of getting somewhere without real changes even in the here and now, let alone eternity. They draw the readers deeper within themselves, round and round in circles while providing no escapes. I like the expression I learned from Bob George’s book “Growing in Grace,” if memory serves me correctly: morbid introspection. Through all this I realized I simply exchanged the books on existentialism, those I used to read before I became a Christian, for books dressed in Christianese with virtually the same content, words that came from the minds of philosophers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;faith-vs-learning-do-vs-done&quot;&gt;Faith vs. learning, do vs. done&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we may learn skills such as computer programming, music, photography, and countless number of skills that are useful in this world’s economy, and many teachers can help us get where we desire, we can’t count on using the same approach toward the kingdom of God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was Nicodemus’ problem when he thought to be born again was to go back to his mother’s womb to start over again. Jesus explained to him that a product of human effort, no matter how well cloaked in spiritual piety, will produce flesh, it will not inherit the incorruptible (1 Corinthians 15:50), he must be born again by the Spirit of God, and the only instrument through which he could achieve this was faith in Christ, not through learning from even the most supreme of teachers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tendency to walk by the flesh, to use it to live out the Christian faith, is exemplified by the Galatians where Paul denounced in no uncertain terms:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Are you so foolish? Having begun by the Spirit, are you now being perfected by the flesh? (Galatians 3:3—NASB)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To begin by the Spirit is to start from God’s grace with nothing to rely on but faith, and perfecting oneself by the flesh is to try to improve from being already good enough for heaven to something even better. It’s this idea that Paul calls foolish. If Christ’s death on the cross is enough to make us perfect so we may come boldly to the throne of grace, how can anyone improve on what He’s already done? And worse yet all the presumed improvements will be done through the strength of the flesh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s take an example of someone who used to have an addiction to gambling, but since he came to Christ, the addiction was gone. This change though positive and it sure will save him from all the pain and suffering from the addiction, it does not make him any more sanctified than the day he received Christ into his heart. Christ did not come to save him from a multitude of sins, but to deliver him from the root of it all, his sin nature, the deliverance from the addiction is just a bonus just as Christ had promised in Matthew 6:33: &lt;em&gt;“Seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you.”&lt;/em&gt; All these things include the overcoming of that besetting sin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;He who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all—how will he not also, along with him, graciously give us all things? (Romans 8:32)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The believer received the gift of deliverance from the addiction along with the greatest gift of all: Christ. The receiving of this gift of deliverance does not make him any more holy, or sanctified, than the moment he received Christ into his heart. Henceforth his life’s focus should be on His Redeemer and not on the gift, or any gift for that matter. It’s the job of the claymaker to mold him into any shape he wishes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Books such as Kempis’ Imitation of Christ are guilty of taking they eyes of Christians off of Christ and turn them inward into themselves. Instead of explaining what Christ had done on the cross, the height, depth, and breadth of God’s plan of salvation, and about the righteousness that is theirs through Christ and everything they need for godliness and contentment that is included with Him, they turn the believers’ eyes toward themselves trying to draw from wretchedness and fallen flesh something to impress God and other people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C.S. Lewis vehemently denounced the very thought of thinking of Christ as a teacher when he wrote this in his book Mere Christianity:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I am trying here to prevent anyone from saying the really foolish thing that people often say about Him [Jesus Christ]: ‘I’m ready to accept Jesus as a great moral teacher, but I don’t accept his claim to be God.’ That is the one thing we must not say. A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher. He would either be a lunatic—on a level with a man who says he is a poached egg—or else he would be the Devil of hell. You must make your choice. Either this man was, and is, the Son of God, or else a madman or something worse. You can shut him up for fool, you can spit at him and kill him as a demon; or you can fall at his feet and call him Lord and God. &lt;strong&gt;But let us not come up with any patronizing nonsense about his being a great human teacher. He has not left that option open to us. He did not intend to.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wholeheartedly agree with C.S. Lewis on that point. That was why when our Sunday School class read the introduction in the new translation of the Book of Matthew I was so taken aback and kept voicing my objection to such description of Jesus as a supreme teacher. Far be it from anyone who calls on the name of Jesus to think of Him as such.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;We’ve all heard of the Ten Commandments, but did you know that originally God gave His people a choice between the law and grace? When God brought the Isrealites out of Egypt, He bore them eagles’s wings. In other words, he delivered them by grace. But instead of being contented to live by His grace, they wanted to live by law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dr-mcgees-sermon&quot;&gt;Dr. McGee’s Sermon&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://vacsf.org/assets/images/law-vs-grace-teaser.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 1px solid #cccccc; margin: 7px 15px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 148px; padding: 0px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;
The excerpt in large print above is from the introduction to Dr. J. Vernon McGee’s wonderful sermon on Exodus 19:4-25 which I happened to catch on the radio on Sept 21, 2016. I must have heard this message from Dr. McGee over thirty years ago, once every year for more than a decade, but never really understood it. I came to this understanding of law vs. grace through a different path, but hearing again from Dr. McGee this time, on the date of its re-broadcast on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/exodus-194-25-552552.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;September 21, 2016&lt;/a&gt;, is quite a heavenly gift. His sermon inspired me to write this article from my own reflections of what this passage means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;delivered-on-eagles-wings&quot;&gt;Delivered on eagles’ wings&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;You yourselves have seen what I did to Egypt and how I lifted you on eagles’ wings and brought you to myself. (Exodus 19:4)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know what was the state of the Israelites in Egypt, they were slaves under the brutal rule of their masters with no hope in sight. And yet here they were, delivered on “eagles’ wings.” This reminds me of Isaiah 40:31 where those who &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;wait&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; upon the Lord will mount up with wings like eagles. This must have been the state of God’s people in Egypt, they were “waiting.” Or maybe they weren’t even waiting; after hundreds of years being slaves for generations in a foreign land, all their hope must have been lost. To wait is to still have some hope for something, therefore to these people whose last ray of hope was all but extinguished, what could they have been waiting for? Either way, waiting or not, they were at the end of their resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This reminder, before the unfolding of events that leads to the giving of the law, the Ten Commandments, that came from the Lord must have been for them not to forget that they did nothing to deserve the magnificent rescue, that it wasn’t anything from themselves that they could get credit for, either their physical or moral prowess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God insists time a time again that it’s &lt;em&gt;“Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit”&lt;/em&gt; (Zechariah 4:6).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-different-kind-of-test&quot;&gt;A different kind of test&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;And now, if you will diligently listen to me and keep my covenant, then you will be my special possession out of all the nations, for all the earth is mine, &lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;and you will be to me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.’ These are the words that you (Moses) will speak to the Israelites.” (Exodus 19:5-6)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wait a minute! Aren’t they already God’s special possession? We know that God already made a covenant with Abraham in Genesis 12:1-3 that He would bless him and all his descendants, and we know that Abraham was called righteous before God because he believed the Lord (Genesis 15:6).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The covenant God made with Abraham was a covenant of faith, but this covenant that is coming down the mountain is altogether a different one that came with a condition that requires their diligent efforts. Why is God asking them now if they want to be His people as if they were not already His in the first place? What changed? No, nothing has changed. God is the same before, now, and forevermore, and He would never go back on His word (Hebrews 6:13-20). The only thing that could have changed was the people, either they didn’t believe God’s promise to their father Abraham, or they had never lived by the faith that was given them through Abraham.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God wasn’t testing whether they would desire or be willing to keep the impending law written on tablets of stone, but whether they trust Him enough to cling to His promise to Abraham. It is this faith that pleases Him, not self aggrandizing law keeping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;foolish-choice-that-they-made&quot;&gt;Foolish choice that they made&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;So Moses came and summoned the elders of Israel. He set before them all these words that the Lord had commanded him, &lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;and all the people answered together, &lt;strong&gt;“All that the Lord has commanded we will do!”&lt;/strong&gt; So Moses brought the words of the people back to the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;ALL THAT THE LORD HAD COMMANDED WE WILL DO!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; As observed from the passage above, either they didn’t believe, or forgot the covenant that God made with father Abraham, or they willingly exchanged that faith based covenant to a law based one, they exchanged grace for law. Though the Lord reminded them that it was on eagles’ wings that He delivered them, they chose to forget it. Much like so many people today who call themselves by Christ’s name steadfastly refuse to walk by faith, because by the law they would have reasons to boast of their own righteousness (Ephesians 2:8-9; Romans 3:27-28).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such foolishness! (Galatians 3:1-6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People often cites Jesus love command &lt;em&gt;“Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind”&lt;/em&gt; (Matthew 22:37) with such self confidence like the people in verse 8 above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s read an interaction between Jesus and a rich young man who came to ask Him how to have eternal life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;Now behold, one came and said to Him, “Good Teacher, what good thing shall I do that I may have eternal life?” &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;So He said to him, “Why do you call Me good? No one is good but One, that is, God. But if you want to enter into life, keep the commandments.” &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;He said to Him, “Which ones?” Jesus said, “‘You shall not murder,’ ‘You shall not commit adultery,’ ‘You shall not steal,’ ‘You shall not bear false witness,’ &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;‘Honor your father and your mother,’ and, ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’ ”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;The young man said to Him, &lt;strong&gt;“All these things I have kept from my youth&lt;/strong&gt;. What do I still lack?”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;Jesus said to him, “If you want to be perfect, go, sell what you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow Me.” &lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions. (Matthew 19:16-22)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The young man in this story committed fatal errors not unlike the Exodus people above when he answered Jesus: “All these things I have kept from my youth.” Really? There is no one under the sun that can keep even a single commandment, let alone keeping all of them, but Jesus knew what is in the heart of this young man and he used it to bring him to the place of admitting his failure: his possessions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The test the Lord presented to the Israelites at the foot of mount Sinai was not whether they’d be able to keep the commandments He was about to give them, but whether they would want to relate to Him in one of the following two ways both of which represent a faith-based relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They trusted the Lord enough to claim His covenant with Abraham (Genesis 12:1-3).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They acknowledge their inability to adhere to the law-based covenant which God was about to deliver and cry out for mercy instead, and pray to Him if they could continue to ride on eagles’ wings for the remainder of their lives. Those who come to God in this manner He would in no wise cast out (John 6:37).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In reminding them of how He had delivered them out of Egypt on eagles’ wings, the Lord was extending to them His hand of mercy but sadly they responded like many gung-ho Christians today: “All that the Lord has commanded we will do!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;three-days-to-change-their-minds&quot;&gt;Three days to change their minds&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;The Lord said to Moses, “I am going to come to you in a dense cloud, so that the people may hear when I speak with you and so that they will always believe in you.” And Moses told the words of the people to the Lord (Exodus 19:9).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;The Lord said to Moses, “Go to the people and sanctify them today and tomorrow, and make them wash their clothes &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;and be ready for the third day, for on the third day the Lord will come down on Mount Sinai in the sight of all the people. &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;You must set boundaries for the people all around, saying, ‘Take heed to yourselves not to go up on the mountain nor touch its edge. Whoever touches the mountain will surely be put to death! &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;No hand will touch him—but he will surely be stoned or shot through, whether a beast or a human being; he must not live.’ When the ram’s horn sounds a long blast they may go up on the mountain.”
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;Then Moses went down from the mountain to the people and sanctified the people, and they washed their clothes. &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;He said to the people, “Be ready for the third day. Do not go near your wives.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Lord gave the people three days to prepare themselves for what is coming. What is He trying to convey to them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The dense cloud in which the Lord is descending shows He’s far from accessible to the people.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Boundaries were set for the people around the edge of the mountain where violators, be they men or beasts, will be stoned or shot through with arrows to death. Once again the inaccessibility of God is affirmed, and &lt;em&gt;“flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable”&lt;/em&gt; (1 Corinthians 15:50)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Even with all these preparations, being sanctified by Moses in whatever shape or form, clothes washed, sexual relations abstained, they could not see God. All that were just to prepare them for the third day; they were just ceremonially clean on the outside with no real change on their sin nature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should these three days facing the terrible mountain of God alarm them enough to beg God for a different condition in their relationship with Him? That they could continue to ride with Him on wings of eagles?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;no-forced-access-allowed&quot;&gt;No forced access allowed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;On the morning of the third day there were thunders and lightnings and a thick cloud on the mountain and a very loud trumpet blast, so that all the people in the camp trembled. &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;Then Moses brought the people out of the camp to meet God, and they took their stand at the foot of the mountain. &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;Now Mount Sinai was wrapped in smoke because the Lord had descended on it in fire. The smoke of it went up like the smoke of a kiln, and the whole mountain trembled greatly. &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;And as the sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder, Moses spoke, and God answered him in thunder. &lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;The Lord came down on Mount Sinai, to the top of the mountain. And the Lord called Moses to the top of the mountain, and Moses went up.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;And the Lord said to Moses, “Go down and warn the people, lest they break through to the Lord to look and many of them perish. &lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;Also let the priests who come near to the Lord consecrate themselves, lest the Lord break out against them.” &lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;And Moses said to the Lord, “The people cannot come up to Mount Sinai, for you yourself warned us, saying, ‘Set limits around the mountain and consecrate it.’” &lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;And the Lord said to him, “Go down, and come up bringing Aaron with you. But &lt;strong&gt;do not let the priests and the people break through to come up to the Lord&lt;/strong&gt;, lest he break out against them.” &lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt;So Moses went down to the people and told them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key idea in this passage is that the people, including the priests, are not allowed to “break through” to come near the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again &lt;em&gt;“It’s not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit”&lt;/em&gt; (Zechariah 4:6). God allows only one means of access to Him: through Christ, and our faith in Him. People forget that it’s the keeping of the law as means to draw near to God that offends Him, and their law keeping may manifest in ways that seem very spiritual: when they pray, when they give their offerings, when they do their good deeds. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;ALL THAT THE LORD HAD COMMANDED WE WILL DO!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Such foolishness that sent them back to the desert for 40 more years and most never made it to the promised land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;law-vs-grace&quot;&gt;Law vs. Grace&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. McGee gave a list of contrasts between the law and grace:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The law demands, grace gives&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The law says do, grace says believe&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The law exacts, grace bestows&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The law says work, grace says rest&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The law threatens pronouncing a curse, grace entreats pronouncing a blessing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The law says do and thou shalt live, grace says live and thou shalt do&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The law condemns the best man, and grace saves the worst man&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The law reveals the character of God, and it also reveals the weakness of man&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is your choice?&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary type="text">We’ve all heard of the Ten Commandments, but did you know that originally God gave His people a choice between the law and grace? When God brought the Isrealites out of Egypt, He bore them eagles’s wings. In other words, he delivered them by grace. But instead of being contented to live by His grace, they wanted to live by law.</summary>

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-world-the-flesh-and-sin&quot;&gt;The world, the flesh, and sin&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://vacsf.org/assets/images/do-not-conform-teaser.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 1px solid #cccccc; margin: 7px 15px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 148px; padding: 0px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;
The general consensus is the world, whose definition we’ll explore later, is something negative that we must take care not to conform to its patterns. This negative something is generally accepted as sinful things that we must get rid of from our lives. The more of these sins we can get rid of, the closer we are to God. Oftentimes Hebrews 12:1 is brought into the picture to support the argument that we should make every effort to get rid of &lt;em&gt;“the sin that easily entangles.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quick survey of all available commentaries reveals that they also hold the same interpretation, or perhaps they influence the rest of Christianity with their points of views? But people don’t really need commentaries to form this world view, all you need is take a survey of some of the major world’s religions, they all hold the same concept of sins and the need to deal with them in various ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All religions hold the belief that the flesh is basically sinful, a negative force that must be subdued or even annihilated if one hopes to achieve a higher state of being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should not be a surprise to us that Christians, most if not almost all, also subscribe to this mode of thinking though it may be dressed in a more appropriate Christian language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the one hand we’re exhorted to “love not the world” (1 John 2:15), on the other hand we must live in it, we share in this world the work we do to make a living, we drive on the same road, we go to the same movie theater, we watch the same TV broadcast, we traverse on the same Internet highway. Wouldn’t this internal conflict cause much trouble in a Christian’s life? Much morbid introspection that weighs heavily on the heart of the one who wants to do the right thing in accordance with their faith?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most commentaries are very long winded about what constitutes this “pattern of the world,” but to simplify the matter, the dividing line is between what is sinful and what is not, isn’t it? Then it logically follows that the command “do not conform to the patterns of this world” can be restated as simply as “do not sin anymore.” Does this make sense? Isn’t this what is implied in all sermons and writings?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s difficult not to talk about the world without also calling into question the issue of sin. This is reflected in all the world’s religions, and Christianity is not exempted from it. Therefore if the question of not conforming to the patterns of the world is to be understood to be analogous to stop sinning, we may be better off taken from this world altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;an-elusive-goal&quot;&gt;An elusive goal&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it possible for anyone to be completely without sin?  The answer is easy right from the Bible itself, therefore if “do not conform” is to be understood in the conventional sense, we’re setting ourselves up for a lifetime of discouragement and hopelessness because the fact of our daily transgression will stare at us in the face on a continual basis. I read that Martin Luther used to take 6 hours per day to confess his sins, but I believe that had Luther, or the listening priest, had the strength, he would have had confessed all day long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-christian-things-that-we-do&quot;&gt;The Christian things that we do&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though most pulpits do not preach it outright, virtually all pew sitters assume this is what they heard: worldly things are those not directly related to Bible study, church activities, ministries, evangelistic endeavors, prayer, etc. The way to please God is to &lt;strong&gt;do&lt;/strong&gt; as many of these things as possible. We read in John 6:28-29 that upon hearing Jesus’ teaching, the crowd asked Him what the works of God were so that they could &lt;strong&gt;do&lt;/strong&gt; them. People also asked Paul in Acts 16:30 about what they must &lt;strong&gt;do&lt;/strong&gt; to be saved. The same type of questions were posed to Jesus in the gospels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a lady in our church who works very hard to provide for her family with many sick people. Occasionally in our Sunday School class she would express her regret that she could not find time to do “God’s works.” I tried very hard to convince her that God’s works are those things she does when she works in her nail salon, when she cares for her sick husband and his sibblings, when she tries to catch a breath from between many responsibilities. In her mind these are “worldly things” that don’t count toward God’s kingdom. But it’s not just this lady who holds such a view of “the world,” it’s probably 99.99% of folks you sit next to every Sunday singing hymns of grace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where does this understanding, or rather misunderstanding, come from? Where else but from the lack of sound teaching to ground the flocks in the absolute promise of salvation to those who call by Jesus’ name. Most messages I heard everywhere are about things Christians should or shouldn’t do. A disproptionate amount of communication is dedicated toward topics such as family, raising children, marriage, work, play, sex, and everything that is perceived as good under the sun. But all these things, as good as most of them are, are not in the exclusive domain of Christianity; they can all be found in non-Christian sources. Christ didn’t come to address these corruptible things. He came to address an issue buried deep in the nature of man. The focus on nonessential matter is the reason few Christians are grounded in the truth of how God saves us and accepts us in His Son Jesus Christ. And when Christians are not deeply rooted in Christ, false doctrine finds its fertile ground to grow like weeds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-romans-context&quot;&gt;The Romans context&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you follow the logic of Romans from chapter 1 all the way to the passages preceding this problem concept of “do not conform to the patterns of this world,” you’d find the following key concepts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul starts out by calling us into an obedience of faith, of believing in Christ, and as it is started with faith, it also ends with faith (Romans 1:17), or in other words: &lt;em&gt;“the just shall live by faith,”&lt;/em&gt; and this is contrary to the pattern of the world in that they live by “works,” by their performances, their human efforts to try to achieve a measure of spiritual perfection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then he continued on to show the Romans that unrepentance is the refusal to trust in Christ alone for their salvation (Romans 2:5), and the role of the law is contrary to what they think, it does not justify but instead condemns, and no one can through the works of the law achieve God’s righteousness (Romans 3:19-20). This reliance on the law to be justified before God is again the way, or the patterns, of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then Paul continued for the remainder of Romans to show people points of contrast between the way of the world and the way of faith, one or human efforts and reliance on the law and one of faith in Christ, one of law and one of grace, one of merit projected from self to one of a gift received from God (Romans 5:15-19). The way of the world will lead to boasting because it is based on the principle of works (Romans 3:27-28).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then in chapter 8 Paul contrasts the seeking of righteousness through the law, which is a pattern of the world, as opposed to the righteousness through Christ (Romans 10:5-13).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-real-meaning&quot;&gt;The real meaning&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore if we always keep in our sight the flow of thoughts that Paul presented from the beginning we’d have seen that “the patterns of the world” is not about philosophical differences between believers and unbelievers in their worldly pursuits, or of the sins they commit, but of the objects of their faith: who they trust to give them the righteousness they need to boldly come into God’s presence. The pattern of the world: works through the law vs. our pattern: grace through faith.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://vacsf.org/assets/images/resist-unto-blood.jpg&quot; style=&quot;border: 1px solid #cccccc; margin: 7px 15px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 148px; padding: 0px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;
The gospel sounds very attractive especially for those who have embarked on a treadmill of religion with no hope of salvation in sight. They heard of Jesus&#39; promise of water that satisfies forever, of rest for the weary, of peace that passes understanding, and how He died on the cross one time for all the sins of mankind, they thought there in this wonderful religion is their hope. But once they got into the fold, after an initial honeymoon of joy unspeakable, somehow they found themselves back on the treadmill. They&#39;re confused but couldn&#39;t quite put their fingers on what is going on. The messages they heard from pulpits for decades seemed different from what they heard when they were still in the dark. They used to hear of the forgiveness of sins, now they keep hearing stern warning of sins that they must &quot;resist unto blood.&quot; It seemed to them the Christians haven&#39;t solved their sin problem.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;!-- ##################### PLACEHOLDER ###################--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than once during these years they’ve heard messages from Hebrews 12:1-4 which left them an impression that their troubles are far from over. Memories of that first love when they knelt at the cross are all but fading. Maybe God didn’t really forgive them at all. Though the number of times they heard sermons on this passage are few, they still served to magnify the giants in the promised land, to sow the seed of doubt and fear concerning their eternal destiny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses, &lt;u&gt;we must get rid of every weight and the sin that clings so closely&lt;/u&gt;, and run with endurance the race set out for us,  &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;keeping our eyes fixed on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of our faith. For the joy set out for him he endured the cross, disregarding its shame, and has taken his seat at the right hand of the throne of God. &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Think of him who endured such opposition against himself by sinners, so that you may not grow weary in your souls and give up.  &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;u&gt;You have not yet resisted to the point of bloodshed in your struggle against sin&lt;/u&gt; (Hebrews 12:2-4).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-sin-that-easily-entangles&quot;&gt;The sin that easily entangles&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The underlined parts of these verses appear to confirm the common interpretation that we must make every effort to banish sins from our lives in order to run the race that is laid out before us. It makes sense, doesn’t it? It makes a lot of sense that a race runner must eliminate anything that can potentially affect his performance. Therefore in a Christian race, sin is a major obstacle that must be dealt with in every aspect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what is the sin that easily entangles? Are they the sins that people commonly fall into, or some special sin—singular? We must go back to the beginning of this Hebrews letter where the author established the framework for us to determine what this sin really is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier in chapter 2, the author warns believer of the risk of drifting away. This gives us a clue as to what we should look for in determining what we might be drifting away from, or toward. There are more signposts all pointing to the main truth that the Hebrews author tries to point us to, and of course they also point us to what is not, but perhaps addressing just these two main topics, the sin that easily entangles, and the drifting away is sufficient for the purpose of this article. Now let us consider next the concept of drifting away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-danger-of-drifting-away&quot;&gt;The danger of drifting away&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Therefore we must pay closer attention to &lt;strong&gt;what we have heard&lt;/strong&gt;, so that we do not &lt;strong&gt;drift away&lt;/strong&gt;.  &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;For if the &lt;strong&gt;message spoken through angels&lt;/strong&gt; proved to be so firm that every violation or disobedience received its just penalty,  &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;how will we escape if we &lt;strong&gt;neglect such a great salvation&lt;/strong&gt;? It was first communicated through the Lord and was confirmed to us by those who heard him,  &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;while God confirmed their witness with signs and wonders and various miracles and gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to his will (Hebrews 2:1-4).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most Christians believe that they have drifted away when work pressure, family needs, health issues, or whatever personal reasons cause them to miss church, to be unavailable for church ministries, or their falling into certain lifestyle causes much pain to themselves and others, to the point they wonder if they’re saved at all. They feel they might drift away if they don’t join every prayer meeting, if they don’t drop a substantial amount in the offering plate when a missionary came fundraising at their church, and myriad other things that they deem important to keep them on the straight and narrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But whatever this drifting away is, it must not be one of those things mentioned above, because there is a tone of utmost urgency in verse 3: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“how will we escape?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; If it is, no Christian will escape because we all will fall into one of these things that rightly or wrongly creates a fear of falling away in our hearts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God’s method of salvation cannot be something that is based on a shifting foundation. If He gives man &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;one way to be saved&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, than their loss of salvation must be based on the failure to adhere to that &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;one way&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. But the message we get from most Christian sources seems much more complicated than that. According to these sources, though there is one way to be saved, there are thousands of ways one can drift away to our ultimate destruction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will resume at a point where we determine what we might drift away from, or toward. Without a clear identification of what it is, a whole ecosystem of how-to’s may evolve with lots of bandwidth wasted without any real help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-shedding-of-blood&quot;&gt;The shedding of blood&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our natural tendency upon reading this part of the passage: &lt;em&gt;“You have not yet resisted to the point of bloodshed in your struggle against sin”&lt;/em&gt; is to think immediately of our battle against the lust of the flesh. But what does Hebrews say about bloodshed, its meaning and its purpose?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In chapter 9, after the writer of Hebrews describes the role of the priest who had to enter into the most holy place to offer the blood of bulls and goats for the peoples’ sins, he went on to compare such blood to the supremacy of the blood of Christ. The inferior blood of bulls and goats only provided ritual, or ceremonial, purity, but the blood of Christ can break down the barrier between the holy of holies and the profane world of fallen flesh to give man access to God. This it does by purifying their consciences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;For if the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a young cow sprinkled on those who are defiled consecrated them and provided ritual purity, &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, purify our consciences from dead works to worship the living God (Hebrews 9:13-14).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was the role of blood in this context be it of animals or of the Son of God? It is to give people the forgiveness they needed in their relationship with God, temporarily by one and eternally by the other. The blood of either one is for the purpose of forgiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore &lt;em&gt;“You have not yet resisted to the point of bloodshed in your struggle against sin”&lt;/em&gt; is not about struggling against sinful temptation, but about how you can pay for the sins that you have and will have committed. All men sin, the problem is how they can pay for them. In the Old Covenant, it was the bulls and goats that paid for them ceremonially, while in the New Covenant Christ paid for them now and forevermore. That is how He resists sin. Don’t you see Christ cannot be tempted because not only does He not have a sin nature, He is Almighty God. His purpose in shedding His own blood is entirely different from what contemporary pulpits try to apply to the controlling of the flesh. Additionally, we should have learned this already from the reason why the animals had to shed their blood: not for fighting against sinful temptations, but for the forgiveness of men’s sins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think from this point on we can eliminate the shedding of blood from the equation. But the article cannot end here though its title is “Resist Unto Blood.” The application that is similarly derived from the concepts of “drifting away” and “the sin that easily entangles” still needs further treatment because their implication is profound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;back-to-the-sin&quot;&gt;Back to “The Sin”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us ask ourselves again: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What is the sin that easily entangles?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; The question is not what are the sins (plural), but the sin (singular), that easily entangles. It’s one specific sin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time when it is written in John 16:8 that Jesus describes the role of the Holy Spirit when he comes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When he comes, he will prove the world to be in the wrong about sin … (John 16:8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How is the world wrong about sin? Well the world has been thinking that sin has to do with something bad that men do, or something good that they fail to do, how can they be wrong? Jesus continued:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;… in regard to sin, because they do not believe in Me (John 16:8).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though someone may manage to never sin as everyone else did, he is in sin, because he came from a sinful lineage, but the moment he believed in Jesus, he’s delivered from sin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then years after Jesus had gone back to heaven leaving in man’s hand the ministry of reconciliation, God gave the Hebrews writer the task of reminding man once again the meaning of sin:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And to whom did He swear that they would never enter His rest? Was it not to those who disobeyed? &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;So we see that it was because of their unbelief that they were unable to enter (Hebrews 3:18-19).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God’s rest is the place where sins are forgiven, where man with unveiled faces can be in God’s presense without shame, where man can relate to God as Abba, Father. The Hebrews writer reminded his audience of the time when God’s people arrived at the Jordan river, all they needed to do were to obey God’s command to cross the Jordan to enter the promised land. Instead of believing God’s promise to bring them to the promised land, instead of listening to Joshua and Caleb, they chose to listen to the ten other spies who reported giants in the land. This was their disobedience, this was their unbelief that prompted God’s anger when He swore that &lt;em&gt;“they would never enter His rest.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again here the Hebrews writer reaffirmed what Jesus said concerning sin: UNBELIEF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is the sin that easily entangles. That is the sin that causes so many folks to not believing in Jesus’ promise of salvation to those who believe in Him. This is the sin that crops up from ministries that are supposed to reconcile men to God but instead caused them to further drift from God, when they proved themselves wrong concerning sin by focusing all their energy in fighting a wrong battle, when they focus on the sins (plural) instead of helping folks to firmly believe in the one that God had sent (John 6:29).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-drift-away-&quot;&gt;The drift away …&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us revisit Hebrews 2:1 which says: &lt;em&gt;“Therefore we must pay closer attention to what we have heard, so that we do not drift away.”&lt;/em&gt; What had they heard? What but the simple truth that the ultimate sin is the sin of unbelief? Didn’t they hear that those who have the Son have eternal life (1 John 5:2)? Didn’t they remember what happened to those who didn’t cross the Jordan to enter the promise land because of their unbelief? Didn’t they remember what Jesus said when He still walked among them saying the real sin is the sin of not believing in Him (John 16:8)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t drift away from that simple but everlasting truth: Jesus is the Way, the Truth, and the Life. Don’t add anything to it, and don’t take anything away from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;in-conclusion&quot;&gt;In Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shedding of blood has nothing to do with battling against the flesh, but it has to do with the forgiveness of sin that only Jesus can provide. The shedding of blood is not something that you’re allowed to do; only the unblemished bulls or goats of the Old Covenant could, and only the Son of God could in the New Covenant. Who are you to try to shed your own blood?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sin that easily entangles is the sin of unbelief, of not putting your full trust of your salvation in Christ’s finished work on the cross.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And don’t drift away from that simple but glorious truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surrender. Rest. Peace. Letting go. But if the Bible says that the flesh desires what is contrary to the Spirit, then how can you surrender to God?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-dilemma&quot;&gt;The dilemma&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/surrender.jpg&quot; style=&quot;border: 1px solid #666666; margin: 7px 15px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 148px; padding: 0px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;
All Christians experience to a varying degree great conflicts between their desire to do the will of God and their inability to do so. The theme Surrender is well visited by various authors through the ages from both Christian and secular sources. To the Christians the ability to surrender means many things; from being able to say no to temptations, to being obedient to what one might deem as the will of God in their lives, to being able to overcome many character flaws that had plagued them since the time their need for a deliverance nudged them toward the place of trust in God.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;!-- ##################### PLACEHOLDER ###################--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul not only described these struggles in the two letters he wrote to the Galatians and the Romans, he also showed us how we may find a solution. The goal of this article is to show that though it is indeed a very desirable and profitable thing to surrender to God, it is never intended to be a goal to be achieved, but instead it is realized by the believers as a byproduct, a fruit, of a much more important thing, a change in mindset, or outlook, in how we walk with God, from law-based obedience to grace-based empowerment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;paul-to-the-galatians&quot;&gt;Paul to the Galatians&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul declared a statement of the fact concerning the reality of the flesh in our lives:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that &lt;u&gt;ye cannot do the things that ye would&lt;/u&gt; (Galatians 5:17).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this verse we clearly read that our flesh’s desire is not the things of God, so it will not voluntarily surrender to God, and the end result is &lt;em&gt;“ye cannot do the things that ye would.”&lt;/em&gt; But most Christians think otherwise, that they can somehow muster the strength to do the things Paul said they couldn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul wrote this as a statement of fact, without exception, which will be further reinforced when we next study the following Romans passage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;paul-to-the-romans&quot;&gt;Paul to the Romans&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;I do not understand what I do. For what I want to do I do not do, but what I hate I do … &lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;u&gt;So I find this law at work&lt;/u&gt;: Although I want to do good, evil is right there with me. &lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;For in my inner being I delight in God’s law; &lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;but I see another law at work in me, waging war against the law of my mind and making me a prisoner of the law of sin at work within me. &lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body that is subject to death? &lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;u&gt;Thanks be to God, who delivers me through Jesus Christ our Lord!&lt;/u&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;So then, I myself in my mind am a slave to God’s law, but in my sinful nature a slave to the law of sin&lt;/u&gt; (Romans 7:15,21-25).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul again describes the same thing he does in Galatians, but here he calls it a law, and a law is just what it is, it cannot fail, like the law of gravity, or other laws that describes the universe. But here Paul goes further to explain why this is the case. The reason being we are made up of two parts: 1) the inner being, the spirit, or the mind, and 2) the flesh, and they are in constant struggle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verse 25 appears to show us a resolution to the conflict, with presumably the flesh to be on the losing side when it wrote: &lt;em&gt;“Thanks be to God, who delivers me through Jesus Christ our Lord!”&lt;/em&gt; But is this really the case? No, this is not the case at all, because if we continue to read to the second part we’d find the opposite to be true, where Paul confirmed the reality of the existence of our two parts side by side: the flesh and the spirit, when he wrote: &lt;em&gt;“So then, I myself in my mind am a slave to God’s law, but in my sinful nature a slave to the law of sin.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our mind, or our spirit, the part that comes alive when we received Christ and the Holy Spirit as a seal of our redemption, loves and obey the law of God. This part does not have any trouble in such a way that it needs to surrender.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While our flesh, our sinful nature, is a slave to the law of sin. Notice the use of the term SLAVE, which suggests a total submission to this law which makes resistance to it an impossibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul reiterates the inability of the flesh to submit to God later in Romans 8 as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;For those who live according to the flesh have their outlook shaped by the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit have their outlook shaped by the things of the Spirit.  &lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;For the outlook of the flesh is death, but the outlook of the Spirit is life and peace,  &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;because the outlook of the flesh is hostile to God, for it &lt;u&gt;does not submit to the law of God, nor is it able to do so&lt;/u&gt; (Romans 8:5-7—NET).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we read that besides the fact that the flesh does not submit to the law of God, it’s unable to do so even if it does desire it. There is a very thorough discussion of the “outlook of the flesh” in the article &lt;a href=&quot;http://vacsf.org/bible-topics/meditations/put-to-death-the-deeds-of-the-body/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;“&lt;u&gt;Mortify the Deeds of the Flesh&lt;/u&gt;”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; which helps us see a more harmful aspect of the flesh not as instrument for sins, but as instrument for righteouness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;to-put-jesus-in-control&quot;&gt;To put Jesus in control?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can put this question another way: Can you surrender to God? Here the old hymn “Fully Surrender” came to mind with the following lyrics:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Fully surrendered—Lord, I would be,&lt;br /&gt;
Fully surrendered, dear Lord, to Thee.&lt;br /&gt;
All on the altar laid,&lt;br /&gt;
Surrender fully made,&lt;br /&gt;
Thou hast my ransom paid;&lt;br /&gt;
I yield to Thee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hymn suggests a willingness, and a decision is made, by the surrendering person to submit to God. But what did Paul write about the flesh? We learned from the Galatians and Romans passages that the flesh will not, and cannot, submit to the law of God. So if we apply Paul’s reasoning to the hymn, though its author may want to surrender to God, his or her flesh &lt;em&gt;“does not submit to the law of God, nor is it able to do so.”&lt;/em&gt; This hymn reflects the sentiment of the majority of Christians who are tired of the constant struggles and simply want to lay down and rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The apostle Paul suggests we do not try to control the flesh, but to walk in the Spirit. We overcome the flesh by not doing battle with it, by not focusing on putting it under submission, but to walk in the Spirit. It will become clearer as we enter the next section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;walk-in-the-spirit&quot;&gt;Walk in the Spirit&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully it has become clear that the focus of ministries should NOT be on the taming of the uncontrollable flesh because the volume of truth we’ve read has shown the futility of doing so. Let us expand the context surrounding Galatians 5:17 to see the solution fo the problem of surrender.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;So I say, &lt;u&gt;walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh&lt;/u&gt;. &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;For the flesh desires what is contrary to the Spirit, and the Spirit what is contrary to the flesh. They are in conflict with each other, so that you are not to do whateverc you want. &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;But &lt;u&gt;if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law&lt;/u&gt; (Galatians 5:16-18).`&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here Paul shows us how to NOT gratify the desires of the flesh, or in other words to achieve a state of surrender, by walking by the spirit instead of doing battle with the flesh which will not submit to the law of God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what does it mean to walk by the spirit? To pray all the time? To consciously put oneself in God’s presence? Read more Bible? Practicing God’s Presence?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What motivates someone to wish for a state of surrender? Isn’t it because of the constant struggle against what that they hate but end up doing anyway because the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is still one more important point that we can easily miss in verse 18: &lt;em&gt;“But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.”&lt;/em&gt; It is the law that amplifies the struggle with the flesh, just like it is written in 1 Corinthians 15:56 which says &lt;em&gt;“the power of sin is the law.”&lt;/em&gt; When someone lives under the law, there is a need to control the flesh, to put it into submission, to make it do the impossible: to submit to the law of God. Verse 18 shows us that it’s the law that puts one in this constant struggle, but you can be set free from the law by walking in the Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we must ask ourselves what is the role of the Holy Spirit in our relationship with God? Jesus describes the role of the Holy Spirit as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;And when he comes, he will prove the world wrong concerning sin and righteousness and judgment – &lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;u&gt;concerning sin, because they do not believe in me&lt;/u&gt;; (John 16:8-9)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus made it simple for us to understand the true meaning of sin, of what separates us from God. So in explaining the role of the Holy Spirit, Jesus shows us that sin is the act of not believing in Him; when someone places their trust in Christ, sin is no longer an issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When one walks according to God’s new law: the law of the spirit of life, which says he who believes on the Son will have eternal life (John 3:36), one experiences a rest from the never ending treadmill of performance where a sense of surrender comes without effort, like a child resting in its mother’s arms. That is how we walk by the spirit. That is how we surrender; not by struggling against flesh and blood (Ephesians 6:12), but by faith, by trusting in Christ’s finished work on the cross.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To surrender from a flesh-based perspective is a never-ending process which will not get one to the place of true yielding to God, but to walk by the Spirit is a once for all act of placing our trust in Christ: It’s Finished! If the world has been wrong concerning sin, it has also been wrong concerning their trying to surrender. Because sin is not about transgressions, but about unbelief in Christ, so it is with surrender, it is not about trying to overcome the flesh, but it’s about resting in the finished work of Christ. One is a never ending treadmill of repeated sacrifices, the other is a once-for-all act by the One who comes from God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;What shall we say then? Are we to remain in sin so that grace may increase? Absolutely not! How can we who died to sin still live in it? (Romans_6:1—NET)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://vacsf.org/assets/images/remain-in-sin.jpg&quot; style=&quot;border: 0px none; margin: 7px 15px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 148px; padding: 0px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;
This article is a twin sibbling of the &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://vacsf.org/bible-topics/meditations/put-to-death-the-deeds-of-the-body/&quot;&gt;Mortify the deeds of the flesh&lt;/a&gt;&quot; article, it sets up the proper foundation for understanding the concept of sin presented here. Of all the key concepts that Martin Luther demanded that readers of Scriptures should grasp, &quot;sin&quot; is perhaps the most important.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;!-- ##################### PLACEHOLDER ###################--&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;What shall we say then? Are we to remain in sin so that grace may increase? &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Absolutely not! How can we who died to sin still live in it? (Romans 6:1—NET)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day a friend shared something his young son asked upon reading a passage from a study bible. The study bible has a note that explains the meaning of “repentance.” It explains that repentance is a turning a way from sin and turn back to God. He saw a quiet concern in his son’s face. The boy knew the impossibility of achieving this repentance in all its full meaning. He’s more honest than many adults who might have read it without giving it much further thought for many reasons; maybe it’s nothing to worry about, maybe they think they have successfully turned away from sins, they sense no reason for distress even if this definition of repentance might turn out to be true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The boy’s understanding of “sin” is representative of virtually every practicing Christian including one hundred percent of Bible commentaries I’ve surveyed on this topic. These commentators, who very likely reflect the Church’s understanding of the concept of sin, assume that the “sin” in Romans 6:1 is limited to a pattern of sin of certain degree of severity such as those spelled out in the Ten Commandments or others; therefore in this sense they can freely count themselves as not among the guilty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These men, the commentators, missed the very basic point of theology that even if they never commit any transgressions known to man, they are “in sin.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mankind-is-always-in-sin&quot;&gt;Mankind is always in sin&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Yet death reigned from Adam until Moses even over those who did not sin in the same way that Adam (who is a type of the coming one) transgressed (Romans 5:14).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Romans 5:14, the apostle Paul established the sinful condition of man: they cannot escape being in sin no matter how hard they try. The sinful condition is not from the sins that they committed or must repent from, it’s the body of death (Romans 7:24) that is inseparable from them until Christ comes again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it is in fact man is perpetually in sin and it is impossible for them to get out of of such state, then why did Paul write in Romans 6:1 that they should not remain in sin? Do you see the contradiction? On the one hand they cannot escape sin, and on the other hand they must not remain in sin?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, such contradiction does indeed exist if one holds the view of sin like the boy as told earlier, or those of the well known Bible commentators. But for so long, Christians accept and live with such contradiction. The boy in our story knew better. He could feel there was something wrong in the study bible note that appeared to be as authoritative as the word of God itself. He saw the contradiction and it put him in distress. As a boy, he saw sin for what it was, no embellishment, no denial, no attempt to cover up with pious platitude. But most of us Christians are like the Pharisees, we see the specks in others but not the logs in our own eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-sacrifices&quot;&gt;The sacrifices&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mankind, the religious people, have always related to God through sin. To deal with sins they offered sacrifices, perform religious rituals, acts of penances, or whatever their religious beliefs dictate. The Jews of the Old Covenant had their own prescribed way to get relief for sins. The Christians of the New Covenant also came up with ways to deal with sins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a perpetual cycle of sin and relief. They could see no other way to relate to God. It is sin that stands between them and their gods. Yet they could not get rid of it completely. Paul wrote these verses in Hebrews that beautifully express the dilemma of those who relate to God through their sin:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;For the law possesses a shadow of the good things to come but not the reality itself, and is therefore &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #d30015;&quot;&gt;completely unable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, by the same sacrifices offered continually, year after year, to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #d30015;&quot;&gt;perfect those who come to worship&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.  &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;For otherwise would they not have ceased to be offered, since the worshipers would have been purified once for all and so have &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #d30015;&quot;&gt;no further consciousness of sin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;?  &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;But in those sacrifices there is a reminder of sins year after year (Hebrews 10:1-3).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the law is “completely unable” to make the believers perfect, sin is everpresent between them and God; as a matter of fact, the sacrifices instead of fully erasing sin, they serve as “reminders” of it. It’s obvious in Paul’s writing that the ultimate goal of the believers is to have “no further consciousness of sin.” But nothing has enabled them to achieve this thus far. As long as there is the consciousness of sin in their minds, they cannot draw near to God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modern Christians mistakenly use 1 John 1:9 as means to eradicate sins, as if their confessions can be used to replace the Old Covenant sacrifices to be repeated over and over again. But even those sacrifices could neither get rid of their sins nor their guilt; the only thing that can accomplish such thing is the blood of Christ. The confession in 1 John 1:8-10 is a confession of faith, of their sinful condition and acknowledging Christ as Savior; it has nothing to do with sin and guilt offering under the Old Covenant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore under the Old Covenant system of sacrifices, or modern versions of penances, man “remain in sin” because the “consciousness of sin” remain in their minds and hearts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-cross&quot;&gt;The cross&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subsequently in Romans 6:6-7, Paul explained how we can be set free from sin’s dominion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;We know that our &lt;u&gt;old man was crucified with him&lt;/u&gt; so that the body of sin would &lt;u&gt;no longer dominate us&lt;/u&gt;, so that we would &lt;u&gt;no longer be enslaved to sin&lt;/u&gt;. &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;(For someone who has died has been freed from sin) (Romans 6:6-7).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to these verses, how were we freed from sin? Through “turning away from sin” like the note on repentance of the study bible? Through the natural view of sin in the eyes of a child? And the various Bible commentators? None of the above. Romans 6:6 says that it is through our old man being crucified with Christ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A slave cannot overcome his master, but must be set free. It’s the same way with our slavery to sin, we cannot wiggle ourselves out of it, no matter how much determination or will power one may possess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore though we did not physically get crucified, we inherit Christ’s crucifixion on the virtue of our faith in Him. It’s the same way we receive this gift of being set free from sin, or our no longer “remain in sin”, all thanks to what Christ had accomplished on the cross.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As long as we still live in our body of flesh, we’ll never be completely free from sin, but our position in Christ has changed, our relationship with God has changed. It has changed from being condemned sinners to being children of God. Though the capacity for sinning is still there with us, we no longer relate to God through sin, but through the cross.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God gives us permission to lead a guilt-free life in our relationship with Him, in our salvation and eternal life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.  2 For the law of the life-giving Spirit in Christ Jesus has set you free from the law of sin and death (Romans 8:1-2).&lt;br /&gt;
As far as the east is from the west, so far has he removed our transgressions from us (Psalms 103:12).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why the apostle Paul wrote these great verses in Romans. To remind them that they had been set free from sin, and they don’t have to remain in the mindset, or the outlook, of being condemned sinners anymore. Now do we know what he really meant? He didn’t mean at all to ask why you still fall into this sin or that sin, but he meant why are you still walking scared like sin still has the power to put you under condemnation, why you still try to pay the ransom though it has already been paid for? Just like soldiers who came back from a long drawn out war still live with terrible memories. They came back to the free world but in their minds they’re still captives. So it is with many Christians who still came back to the place where they offered sacrifices for their sins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t have to remain in sin. Christ has set you free.&lt;/p&gt;
