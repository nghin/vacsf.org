    &lt;p&gt;Most people ponder the question “What must I do to inherit the kingdom of God?” Case in point is it is the same question the rich young ruler asked Jesus in Matthew 19:16. It’s a good question, but the answer is not what most folks are looking for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-assumption&quot;&gt;The assumption&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://vacsf.org/assets/images/what-is-good-teaser.jpg&quot; style=&quot;border: 1px solid #cccccc; margin: 7px 15px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 148px; padding: 0px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;
Faithful adherents of practically all religions of the world try to solve the problem of what good deeds they must do to get to the place promised in their systems of beliefs. Resisting sins is part of the solution, part of the “good deeds” they must do, but it is still a much narrower aspect of the whole range of good deeds that they must navigate. Thus in asking such question, they’re possessed by a fallacy that they can indeed do all the good deeds required to enter God’s kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us consider the main Scripture passage of this article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;matthew-1916-22&quot;&gt;Matthew 19:16-22&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; Now someone came up to him and said, Teacher, what good thing must I do to gain eternal life? &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt; He said to him, &lt;strong&gt;Why do you ask me about what is good? There is only one who is good&lt;/strong&gt;. But if you want to enter into life, keep the commandments. &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; Which ones? he asked. Jesus replied, Do not murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not give false testimony, &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt; honor your father and mother, and love your neighbor as yourself. &lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; The young man said to him, I have wholeheartedly obeyed all these laws. What do I still lack? &lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt; Jesus said to him, &lt;strong&gt;If you wish to be perfect&lt;/strong&gt;, go sell your possessions and give the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me. &lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt; But when the young man heard this he went away sorrowful, for he was very rich.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-must-i-do&quot;&gt;What must I do?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question, posed to Jesus by the rich young ruler in the passage, is representative of the thinking of virtually everyone when it comes to the matter of salvation, or eternal life. It’s an inescapable fact. There are things to be done. There are rituals, practices, and countless methods people conjure up to perhaps satisfy some arbitrary requirements of whichever deities they worship. In my own cultural experience, though people may not possess any notion of eternal life, or any deity, they expect rewards and blessings for good deeds they’ve done in this life, and perhaps in the life beyond. All they need to do is to cross their fingers and do the right thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The young ruler’s question to Jesus is no exception, and likewise has two fundamental problems: 1) the assumption that works, some things they do, can get them into God’s kingdom, and 2) the very reference to &lt;strong&gt;good work&lt;/strong&gt; in the question. The apostle Paul addresses the first problem in most of his letters—salvation is by grace, not works—, while the error in the second problem is indirectly answered by Jesus and further confirmed throughout Scriptures, especially in Paul’s letters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;works-and-eternal-life&quot;&gt;Works and eternal life&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Works are good things all Christians should do. They give them a chance to work out their faith through gifts endowed from above, to feel a sense of personal significance as they participate in God’s works toward His kingdom, plus many other benefits. But works contribute nothing toward our entering into the kingdom of God, and His righteousness. It’s when these works are elevated as if they can make or break our relationship with God, they steal the glory of God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ephesians 2:8-9 says we’re saved by faith and not by works. Additionally, the works that we do are not something we come up with on our own, but are those that God had prepared for each and every one of His children according to His infinite wisdom: &lt;em&gt;“For we are his workmanship, having been created in Christ Jesus for good works that &lt;strong&gt;God prepared beforehand&lt;/strong&gt; so we may do them (Ephesians 2:10).”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hebrews 10:10 puts this in a different way:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;By his will we have been made holy through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all (Hebrews 10:10).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be made holy is to be set apart for God’s kingdom, the very thing sought after by the rich young ruler in Matthew 19:16. It’s not any works, even the best of good works, but the offering of the body of Christ that makes the young man holy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God clearly insists in Romans 11:6 that salvation can never be based on any works of man but by God, and He gives it freely to those who believe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And if [&lt;em&gt;salvation is&lt;/em&gt;] by grace, then it cannot be based on works; if it were, grace would no longer be grace (Romans 11:6).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can cite many more verses that will completely demolish any idea that people may enter God’s kingdom through some works of their own, but these should suffice. However the problem with most Christians is not that they don’t believe they’re saved by grace, it’s their utter dependence on works to maintain their relationship with God. They believe that the works that they do after they’re saved will make them more holy, more perfect, until the day they meet God. They call it the sanctification process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this is not what the Bible says. It says we’re both saved and then live by faith alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For by grace you are saved through faith, and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God; it is not from works, so that no one can boast (Ephesians 2:8-9).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;For the righteousness of God is revealed in the gospel &lt;strong&gt;from faith to faith&lt;/strong&gt;, just as it is written, “The righteous shall &lt;strong&gt;live by faith&lt;/strong&gt;.” (Romans 1:17; Galatians 3:11; Hebrews 10:38)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Works, those initiated and powered by the flesh, cannot get us in God’s kingdom because they neither please God nor satisfy His righteous requirements. Therefore it stands to reason that neither will these works please God in the part of life post salvation. This truth is confirmed in Romans 1:17 quoted above: &lt;em&gt;“For the righteousness of God is revealed in the gospel &lt;strong&gt;from faith to faith&lt;/strong&gt;.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Galatians Christians also committed this egregious error such that the apostle Paul had to scold them: &lt;em&gt;“Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh? (Galatians 3:3—KJV)”&lt;/em&gt; There are never supposed to be any works in a Christian’s life; works to earn salvation, works to earn God’s favor. Works that are produced through the believers as a byproduct, an outworking of the indwelling Holy Spirit, is never an issue, unless it is paraded before them so much it becomes dead works of the flesh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If faith is the only means through which you can get in God’s kingdom, it alone is the only means for you to live as a child of God. And the works that God has prepared for each individual (Ephesians 2:10) is a different kind of work altogether, as God himself will see to it that they get done, &lt;em&gt;“for it is God who works in you &lt;strong&gt;to will and to act&lt;/strong&gt; in order to fulfill his good purpose (Philippians 2:13—NIV).”&lt;/em&gt; These works are gifts from God as He gives them to us along with His Son. These works are never a measure of our standing before Him, because if they are, who among us can judge what works are good enough?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;only-god-is-good&quot;&gt;Only God is good&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you notice the peculiarity of Jesus’ response to the young man’s question? Don’t you know only God is good? And how can you who are not good produce anything good?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;No good tree bears bad fruit, nor does a bad tree bear good fruit (Luke 6:43).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it’s not only that you cannot through works get to heaven, you don’t even have what it takes to produce good works for that matter. The prophet Isaiah has this assessment of our condition: &lt;em&gt;“All of us have become like one who is unclean, and all our &lt;strong&gt;righteous acts are like filthy rags&lt;/strong&gt;; we all shrivel up like a leaf, and like the wind our sins sweep us away (Isaiah 64:6).”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, someone may argue that we have been saved so we we can do all things through Christ who strengthens us (Philippians 4:13). But is it true, that we can achieve what that was previously impossible? That Jesus’ retort to the young man no longer applies to us? That what He said, &lt;em&gt;“Only God is good,”&lt;/em&gt; no longer holds true? Nothing is further from the truth. God is still the only One who is good, and we’re still sinners saved by grace. We still suffer the consequences of the Fall. We still die, get sick, and sinful thoughts and actions still govern a large part of our lives. The only thing that is certain is our freedom from condemnation and God’s promise of eternal life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To think otherwise is to set ourselves up for constant failures that ultimately will put doubts in our minds that we may not be saved at all, because if we are, why do we still carry our body of death all day long? (Romans 7:24)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What Jesus said, &lt;em&gt;“Only God is good,”&lt;/em&gt; to the one who is fully resolved in his heart that he can no longer be led by the law in his relationship with God, but by His grace and mercies alone, is like a big boulder fallen off his back. A relief from the great burden of having to &lt;em&gt;“Be perfect (Matthew 5:48).”&lt;/em&gt; A permission to be sinners, warts and all, instead of the drudgery of the futile pursuit of trying to be like God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bearing-fruit&quot;&gt;Bearing fruit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The young man in our story attempts to do some good works to earn his place in heaven, but Jesus said good works are produced by Him and through Him after we’re already saved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“I am the vine, you are the branches. He who abides in Me, and I in him, bears much fruit; for without Me you can do nothing (John 15:5).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To think otherwise is to put the cart before the horse. The bearing of fruit is a natural byproduct of our being attached to the vine. You cannot try to induce the fruit bearing, or good works, through force or threatening, no matter how subtle. It’s the outworking of the vine, not the branches. And how do the branches abide in the vine? Through faith, the only instrument God allows Christians to abide in their Redeemer. Their fruit springs forth they know neither when nor how (John 3:8).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;The kingdom of God is like someone who spreads seed on the ground. &lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt;He goes to sleep and gets up, night and day, and the seed sprouts and grows, though &lt;strong&gt;he does not know how&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By itself the soil produces a crop&lt;/strong&gt;, first the stalk, then the head, then the full grain in the head. &lt;sup&gt;29&lt;/sup&gt;And when the grain is ripe, he sends in the sickle because the harvest has come.” (Mark 4:26-29)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An inordinate amount of energy in Christendom is spent on the growing business through all kinds of media. All these efforts end up leading people away from Christ, but toward those they revered as closer to God than themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;only-god-is-good---part-2&quot;&gt;Only God is good - part 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christians ask the same question as the young ruler all the time, in various shape or form, and for whatever reason. Before they knew Christ, they asked so they could enter heaven, now that they’ve known Him, they ask so they could please Him, to be more fit for His kingdom, to be more holy, more sanctified, more perfect. But Jesus’ response to them will still be the same: only God is perfect. Why are you asking this &lt;em&gt;“with words without knowledge (Job 38:2)?”&lt;/em&gt; The only way to access God’s throne is through the &lt;em&gt;“offering of the body of Christ once for all (Hebrews 10:10).”&lt;/em&gt; The asking of such question reveals only one thing: your pride.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Philippians 2:12 says &lt;em&gt;“work out your own salvation with fear and trembling”&lt;/em&gt;, and Christians roll up their sleeves to get busy. And more than just getting busy, they do it with fear and trembling, too. This article will show that traditional interpretations of &lt;em&gt;“work out”&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;“fear and trembling”&lt;/em&gt; are problematic and incongruous with the rest of Scriptures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;work-out-your-own-salvation&quot;&gt;Work out your own salvation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://vacsf.org/assets/images/work-out-your-own-salvation-teaser.jpg&quot; style=&quot;border: 1px solid #cccccc; margin: 7px 15px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 148px; padding: 0px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;
Now that you have received your salvation from Jesus Christ who died on the cross for your sins, it’s time you work it out, make worthwhile the sacrifice of the Son of God. GotQuestions.dot.org describes this “work out” as “… actively pursuing obedience in the process of &lt;u&gt;sanctification&lt;/u&gt; … ‘straining’ and ‘pressing on’ toward the goal of Christlikeness,” while DesiringGod.dot.org has an article with the title “Why &lt;u&gt;MUST&lt;/u&gt; We Work Out Our Salvation?” It explains the reason why: “the works we do &lt;u&gt;prove&lt;/u&gt; that our faith is real. Works are evidence of election.” Different sources give different reasons, but they all point to the need for a Christian to work out their salvation. These interpretations are also consistent with the messages I’ve heard from varying sources over the years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two key concepts in the views expressed above that go against my core belief: sanctification as a process, and works that prove our faith.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I don’t believe sanctification is a process, but it’s a once-for-all gift from God as we place our trust in Christ’s sacrifice. Let’s consider the verse below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified (Hebrews 10:14—KJV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And secondly, I don’t believe our faith must be predicated upon one or more works, because if it is, no one will ever know what work, or works, it is that qualify their faith. Ephesians 2:8-9 are probably the most well known verses that can be used to illustrate this point:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For by grace you are saved through faith, and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God; it is not from works, so that no one can boast (Ephesians 2:8-9—NET).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let’s read Philippians 2:12 in its entirety, and let’s also add verse 13 for clarity:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Wherefore, my beloved, as &lt;strong&gt;ye have always obeyed&lt;/strong&gt;, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure (Philippians 2:12-13—KJV).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As evident from this verse, the problem is not obedience as the Philippian Christians &lt;em&gt;“have always obeyed,”&lt;/em&gt; not just while Paul was with them, but even more so while he was absent. Paul didn’t write that the people SHOULD work out their salvation, or they MUST, or they should MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO, nor did he make any promise of rewards if they do, or gave veiled threats if they don’t, work out their salvation. He questioned the quality of their works, the foundation upon which they work out their salvation. Are they doing things out of envy or selfish ambition? Or are they doing it out of the love for the brethren?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no doubt from the reading of Philippians 2 that the focus is not with the concern whether they work out their salvation, but with how they should do the works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;with-fear-and-trembling&quot;&gt;With fear and trembling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really didn’t have to labor the point as it is rather clear that verse 13 explains the true meaning of  &lt;em&gt;“with fear and trembling.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A New Covenant Christian no longer operates from the realm of the flesh, but from a spirit of grace where he knows everything he does, he deserves no credit, of which he should not boast, for it is God who works in him &lt;em&gt;“both to will and to do of His good pleasure.”&lt;/em&gt; Whenever the flesh is involved, there is self-glorification, and boasting. Ephesians 2:8-9 says since we’re saved by grace, and not by works, we have no reason to boast about ourselves or our abilities. In Romans 3:27, the apostle Paul also discouraged people from boasting as he pointed out to the Romans that they now lived under a new law, one that required faith, not works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, when a New Covenant Christian still uses the law as his guide, he will always look to himself as the prime mover in all his actions. If he does what is expected of him, he gets the blessings, and conversely, if he does not, he stands a chance of losing out on his blessings. This mindset creates an environment where boasting and self promotion thrive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, Paul must have used the phrase &lt;em&gt;“fear and trembling”&lt;/em&gt; as a contrast to the opposite attitude of pride, for the reason being &lt;em&gt;“it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.”&lt;/em&gt;  It is God, not you! So don’t go and strut your stuff, don’t brag about what good things you’ve done for God. Paul does not mean at all that the working out of our salvation involves any sense of duty, obedience, gratitude, reciprocation to what Jesus had done for us, or any other guilt producing motivation at all. He didn’t need to because his audience the Philippians &lt;em&gt;“have always obeyed.”&lt;/em&gt; The danger they faced was not that they were lazy, but in the attitude of their heart involving only one thing: Are they relying on God’s grace, or their own works, in their relationship with God? Do they know that it is God who works in them both &lt;em&gt;“to will and to do”&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is really no need for anyone to serve God in “fear and trembling,” in the atmosphere expected under a ruthless taskmaster. Paul articulated strenuously in several epistles the case for our relating to God through grace only, not works. Paul is also the one who asks us to grow up and stop feeding on the basic teaching of repentance from dead works, or vice versa repentance from NOT doing good works (Hebrews 6:1-2). Therefore, far be it from him to preach “fear and trembling” in the literal sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;working-what-out&quot;&gt;Working WHAT out?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most Christians assume the working out of our salvation involves only things pertaining to faith. Some examples are: going to church, bible study, revival camp, spiritual retreats, evangelistic outreach, preaching the gospel, etc. But did Jesus die to redeem us only for these things? Or he died to restore all the things that make us who we are? Our profession, hope, aspiration, fear, sorrow, pain, joy, weaknesses, strength, personality, ideosyncrasies, and many things that made King David exclaim &lt;em&gt;“I praise you because I’m fearfully and wonderfully made”&lt;/em&gt; (Psalm 139:14).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To work out your salvation is to live the life that God made you in the first place, but with a difference. You used to live in self pity, but now you’re loved by God. You used to indulge in sinful activities to get temporary relief from pain but now, with hearts full of love from God, you’re set free to know the difference. You used to live a life without meaning but now you know you have a special place in the heart of God and his eternal kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t need anyone to tell you that you need to breathe fresh air to live, so it is with the working out of your salvation. It is God who creates this wonderful air for you to breathe, it is also him who works in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure. The caveat is tread lightly, don’t become filled with prideful arrogance, but if there is an attitude you should have, it should be of fear and trembling as you did nothing to deserve even the salvation that you have.&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary type="text">Philippians 2:12 says “work out your own salvation with fear and trembling”, and Christians roll up their sleeves to get busy. And more than just getting busy, they do it with fear and trembling, too. This article will show that traditional interpretations of “work out” and “fear and trembling” are problematic and incongruous with the rest of Scriptures.</summary>

    &lt;p&gt;What seems to preoccupy most Christians is the issue of sin, both of the things you should do but don’t do, and of the things you should not do but you do. The same thing is also true with the majority of Christian teaching which is dedicated toward solving this perennial problem. But the key verse we’re studying in this article denounces it as elementary teaching while it admonishes us to move on to maturity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;repentance&quot;&gt;Repentance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://vacsf.org/assets/images/repentance-from-dead-works-teaser.jpg&quot; style=&quot;border: 1px solid #cccccc; margin: 7px 15px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 148px; padding: 0px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;
The irony is it is the very issue of sin that drives people to Jesus, but it still plagues them years after they came to Christ. In their mind, they believe their sins are forgiven once and for all when they placed their trust in Christ, and through that faith they have eternal life, access to God through prayer, and many other fundamental beliefs. However, there seems to be a great disparity between what they believe in theory—the church’s doctrines that they hold—, and how they live out these beliefs in real life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quick survey on the internet shows the following definition of repentance:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“What is repentance? Is it just a single decision that leads to baptism? No, it also must be an ongoing frame of mind, recognizing that &lt;strong&gt;overcoming sin is a lifetime effort&lt;/strong&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overcoming sin as an ongoing frame of mind, and a lifetime effort. My decades of listening to sermons in church or on the radio, and book reading shows the statement above is quite accurate of the approach most Christians take in their walk with God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So out of the desire to be more thorough in laying the groundwork for this article, I continued to survey the internet for more opinions on this topic of repentance. The more I searched, the heavier the burden I felt, but the peculiar thing is, in as many exhortations as I found, no one gave a clear answer as to how a Christian can reliably get to where they’re supposed to go. Let’s consider this quote from J. I. Packer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Repentance means turning from &lt;strong&gt;as much as you know&lt;/strong&gt; of your sin to give &lt;strong&gt;as much as you know&lt;/strong&gt; of yourself to &lt;strong&gt;as much as you know&lt;/strong&gt; of your God, and as our knowledge grows at these three points so &lt;strong&gt;our practice of repentance has to be enlarged&lt;/strong&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As much as you know? Clear as mud, isn’t it? How much must I know so I can come to a state of resolution where my soul may rest? Hurriedly, I closed all the browser tabs opened up for searches on repentance, as the more I searched, the more confused I became. There wasn’t a single thing I could find that would help people do consistently to maintain their peace with God. There is though one silver lining in this endeavor, I was reminded of how far I’ve come since I came to Christ. The heaviness I felt, the great burden on my back much like that which was on Christian’s back in John Bunyan’s Pilgrim’s Progress, was reminiscent of the years before I found peace with God. Such longing for peace, for self acceptance, for life’s meaning. Why do these pillars of faith make people more confused? Why don’t they point them to the real solution? Or maybe they only pretend to know the answer?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, I wasn’t looking for an answer for myself, but for my readers who are still struggling to find that place of rest. I found this wonderful rest that is written in Hebrews 4:11 and out of exceeding joy I’m now pointing others to it. The path to it doesn’t require any work, nor any repentance as I shall prove later, but it does require one thing: to believe, even with a faith as small as a mustard seed. Now back to our discourse on repentance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are as many views on the meaning of repentance as there are denominations multiplied by the number of individuals with their own experiences. This article does not aim to prove the correctness or errors of certain views, but it aims to question whether the most commonly accepted view of repentance, with the overcoming of sin as its most dominant objective, in the Christian world view of an average believer, is what God has in mind for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-knowledge-of-good-and-evil&quot;&gt;The knowledge of good and evil&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repentance is not a new concept, as a matter of fact it’s almost as old as time itself when the knowledge of good and evil began to inhabit the hearts of Adam and Eve after they ate of the forbidden fruit, and this was perhaps many millennia before the Ten Commandments were given. This new knowledge began to create inner conflicts in the heart of man with the deafening voice of their conscience constantly either accusing or defending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For whenever the Gentiles, who do not have the law, do by nature the things required by the law, these who do not have the law are a law to themselves. They show that the work of the law is written in their hearts, as their conscience bears witness and their conflicting thoughts accuse or else defend them (Romans 2:14-15).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to the Fall in Eden, there was no need for repentance for man did not possess the knowledge of good and evil. But now with a ruthless judge dwelling in their conscience, surely there must be responses either of denial, or tears of repentance, or inner conflicts that put them in great turmoil. Then the Lord God reduced the breadth of the conscience-based law into a set of clearer, easier to grasp, standards, the Ten Commandments, so man can more easily measure themselves, so that perhaps they may realize how far they have fallen short of God’s glory and be more willing to place their trust in the Messiah when he comes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-vicious-cycle&quot;&gt;The vicious cycle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So over the ages, man sinned and they repented, and the cycle repeats over and over again, the vicious cycle of sin and repentance. How many thousand more years before they can break free from it? Granted they can offer sacrifices, or verbal confessions, for their sins, but those are only temporary measures until they sin again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The law is only a shadow of the good things that are coming—not the realities themselves. For this reason it can never, by the same sacrifices repeated endlessly year after year, make perfect those who draw near to worship. Otherwise, would they not have stopped being offered? For the worshipers would have been cleansed once for all, and would &lt;strong&gt;no longer have felt guilty&lt;/strong&gt; for their sins. But those sacrifices are an annual reminder of sins. It is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins (Hebrews 10:1-4).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you notice the words in bold face above? It indicates there is an effective remedy for the issue of sin which would once for all cleanse the worshippers and remove their guilty conscience. Here are what that remedy is NOT. It’s not sacrifices of bull and goats. It’s not your confession of sins. It’s not your penances or whatever forms of making amends. It is the body of Christ:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Then he said, “Here I am, I have come to do your will.” He sets aside the first to establish the second. And by that will, we have been made holy through the sacrifice of the &lt;strong&gt;body of Jesus Christ once for all&lt;/strong&gt; (Hebrews 10:9-10).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;breaking-free&quot;&gt;Breaking free&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the repentance God wants. Not the kind of repentance to be repeated over and over again of dead works, or of the bad things that we do, but a once-for-all kind of repentance of the ultimate sin of unbelief. This repentance has to do with our trusting that though we will still sin until the day we die, Christ’s death on the cross gives us a once-for-all forgiveness of sins that breaks the cycle to set us free. Dare you believe what Hebrews 10:2 says: &lt;em&gt;“no longer have felt guilty for their sins”&lt;/em&gt;? Is God promoting sins by giving man such freedom from a guilty conscience? No, because elsewhere in Scriptures it is written that a conscience free from guilt actually promotes holy living.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we come to the verse that gives this article its title:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;So let us stop going over the basic teachings about Christ again and again. Let us go on instead and become mature in our understanding. Surely we don’t need to start again with the fundamental importance of repenting from evil deeds and placing our faith in God (Hebrews 6:1—New Living Translation)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doesn’t this sound familiar, if you’re a faithful churchgoer who never missed a Sunday sermon? Of course, I’m exaggerating as who wouldn’t miss a Sunday or two. Repenting from evil deeds and faith in God are the two most common underlying themes no matter what topic is being addressed. Furthermore, the Hebrews author calls them “basic teachings,” or elementary teachings in some other translations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what’s wrong with a good dose of teaching that all Christians must repent from evil deeds? And what’s wrong with teaching that Christians should have faith in God?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;repentance-from-dead-works&quot;&gt;Repentance from dead works&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t make sense that Christians must be reminded ad nauseum that they should repent from dead works, or from sinful actions. Even a child know that, or to take it further, even an unbeliever know that. How do we know that? Let’s quote again the verse shown earlier in the “Knowledge of good and evil” section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For whenever the Gentiles, who do not have the law, do by nature the things required by the law, these who do not have the law are a law to themselves. They show that the work of the law is written in their hearts, as their conscience bears witness and their conflicting thoughts accuse or else defend them (Romans 2:14-15).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The knowledge of good and evil ensures that every descendant of Adam and Eve is capable of repentance, especially repentance from bad deeds to be more specific. Some among them may choose certain course of action in response to their inner voices, by shedding tears of sorrow, or determining in their heart to never repeat the same mistakes, or finding ways to quiet the accusing voices. No matter what their choices are, the capacity for repentance is present as a result of their possessing the knowledge of good and evil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore if an unbeliever, a spiritually dead person, knows intimately the meaning of repentance from evil deeds, shouldn’t a Christian, one who is indwelled by the Third Person of the Godhead, know any less? Wouldn’t the Spirit of God who breathed life into them guide them in the way everlasting?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, the problem Christians have is not that they sin and they love their sins, but &lt;em&gt;“For I do not do the good I want, but I do the very evil I do not want! (Romans 7:19).”&lt;/em&gt; Such is the common experience of genuine born again believers, even including the apostle Paul himself. They hate the evil things that they do. What Paul said is contrary to the volume of teaching we hear everyday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why all the teaching on this aspect is considered childish, elementary, and basic, by the Hebrews’ author who seems to say: Please, no more basic stuff; there’s no need to keep telling Christians of sins and repentance. They’re wracked with guilt already, and don’t know how to break free from the cycle of sin and repentance. Therefore, to teach them to sin no more is to keep them going round and round in the desert of sin and repentance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;have-faith-in-god&quot;&gt;Have faith in God&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though this article’s title does not contain this part of the key verse, it might as well be tackled as part of the “elementary teaching” dismissed by the Hebrews’ author, since what that makes a Christian go to church, to tune to Christian radio, to buy a Christian book, is their faith in God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it’s entirely possible that their faith in God is like a bruised reed or a smoldering wick (Matthew 12:20), they should be built up in a manner different than constant exhortation that they should have faith in God. The focus should be on the object of their faith, not in faith itself. The more they know the object of their faith, the stronger their faith will be. And we know what it is, the object of their faith, that is the Lord Jesus Christ, as included with Him are all the wonderful things he’s accomplished for them, from the forgiveness of their sins to the assurance of their salvation, and to the full righteousness that he bestowed on them as children of God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, focus on the object of their faith, not in faith itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;i-will-be-their-god&quot;&gt;I will be their God&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“For this is the covenant that I will establish with the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord. I will put my laws in their minds and I will inscribe them on their hearts. And &lt;strong&gt;I will be their God and they will be my people&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“And &lt;strong&gt;there will be no need at all for each one to teach his countryman or each one to teach his brother saying, ‘Know the Lord,’ since they will all know me, from the least to the greatest&lt;/strong&gt;.
“For I will be merciful toward their evil deeds, and &lt;strong&gt;their sins I will remember no longer&lt;/strong&gt;.” (Hebrews 8:10-12; Jeremiah 31:33-34)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The elementary teachings keep Christians from maturing in their faith. Instead of helping the believers fix their eyes on Christ, they keep them fixated on themselves, their sins and the never-ending state of guilt expressed through repentance— I’m not, of course, talking about the repentance that brought them to Christ, but about the repentance the average Christians equate with remorse, with feeling sorry for their sinful actions—.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, Hebrews 6:1 tells us to no longer build our faith on the foundation of &lt;em&gt;“repentance from dead works,”&lt;/em&gt; which means to no longer make sins and repentance the focal point of our ministries, our sermons, our Sunday School studies, and many other means of teaching. Only then can we move on to maturity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Live in this truth, and teach it to your congregation: &lt;em&gt;“their sins I will remember no longer.”&lt;/em&gt; If God had said so, and you believed it, then don’t parade your sins before Him anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Almost all Christians must have heard at least more than once sermons that encourage them to deny themselves, take up their cross, and follow Jesus as both a commandment and a promise that they would experience peace, joy, and ultimately a more fulfilling Christian life. Is this what Jesus had in mind when he spoke these words?&lt;/p&gt;

At first glance, the three aspects of what Jesus spoke in Matthew 16:24 appear to be achievable goals, and Christians set out to achieve these goals with a vengeance. A huge amount of communication is dedicated toward teaching Christians how to achieve a measure of success toward these goals. But is a measure of success good enough? For certainly Jesus was not speaking to those who were already in God’s kingdom, but to the lost world of the requirements for entering it. He is posing an impossible standard that only he could achieve: to deny one’s self, to bear the cross, and to follow in his footstep. This article will show that these are not challenges to see who qualifies for God’s kingdom, but are stern ominous shouts from the One who is going to the cross: “Will you surrender?”. We should not hear it with any less alarm than the terrifying scene around mount Sinai when the law was about to be delivered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article was inspired from a verse that was quoted at the end of an email. This verse, which I had heard sermons on it several times in my decades of sitting in my church pews, over the radio, or through Christian literature that I devoured in my early years as a Christian, became my life’s purpose years before Rick Warren’s Purpose Driven Life was written.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;matthew-1624&quot;&gt;Matthew 16:24&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me (Matthew 16:24)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you hover over this verse Matthew 16:24 and right-click to open it in a new window or tab, you’d find a short commentary on the verse: “Discipleship is costly.” This subtitle is found in the NASB, Amplified, and various other versions. No, discipleship is much more than being costly, it’s priceless. It took God’s only begotten Son to pay for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;self-denial&quot;&gt;Self denial&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To what extent does Jesus ask you to deny yourself? Denying yourself of certain pleasures by restricting certain foods or drinks, or follow the pattern of the Colossians who prescribed “do not handle, do not taste, do not touch” (Colossians 2:21), or other forms of personal sacrifice? No, Hebrews 9:22 says that &lt;em&gt;“without the shedding of blood there can be no forgiveness of sins.”&lt;/em&gt; And it’s not just a spilling of some blood, it’s all of it until death, and that was what Jesus did. He died. The condition for becoming his disciple, for following him, is not just mere denial of something, but a denial unto death through the shedding of your own blood. And even then, when you did shed your own blood, it wouldn’t do you any good because you don’t qualify as an unblemished sacrifice. The Old Covenant requirement for sacrificial beasts is they have to be accepted by the High Priest as unblemished. Jesus is unblemished but you are not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now why am I talking about death when the verse only talks about self denial? Because Jesus spoke these words as a condition for salvation, not discipleship. The New Covenant was not yet made available until Christ denied himself by enduring the cross. He was asking his listener though they did not know what he was alluding to: can you endure what I’m about to endure? But of course, this is just a rhetorical question, because your death on the cross will not yield the righteousness you need for an entrance into God’s kingdom, as I had alluded to earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is another aspect of self that no sinner can deny. It’s their Adamic nature. No matter what amount of obedience or lawkeeping can rid them off the part of them that the apostle Paul referred to as he cried: &lt;em&gt;“Wretched man that I am! Who will rescue me from this &lt;strong&gt;body of death&lt;/strong&gt;?”&lt;/em&gt; It’s the part that became ours when Adam and Eve lost eternal life in the garden of Eden. Self denial is a pipe dream, but it became a reality for us when we came to trust in Christ who died on our behalf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For you have died and your life is hidden with Christ in God (Colossians 3:3).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is how you deny yourself, by the grace of God and by your faith in the One who God had sent to die for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;take-up-your-cross&quot;&gt;Take up your cross&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is just a continuation of the denial of self explained above. The cross requires the one who carries it to end up at the point of death. It’s not at all the kind of cross people generally think of, the cross of life’s struggles, or of trials and tribulations. It’s the cross to pay for someone’s sin, and, as discussed earlier in the self denial section, no one is qualified to endure such cross except Jesus Christ. In short, can you endure a cross to the point of death?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;following-jesus&quot;&gt;Following Jesus&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again, Jesus does not simply call men to become his disciples, but he calls them first to become children of God, citizens of his kingdom, to pass from death to life, or to put it simply to be saved. While he spoke Matthews 16:24, He was still preparing the world to receive his free gift of life through his death on the cross. Jesus was using the language of the world when he called them to follow him. Adherents of other religions follow their leaders while Christians enjoy the fellowship with Jesus making his abode in their hearts. He no longer calls those who trust in him servants, but friends and children of God. The work that we do as citizens of God’s kingdom is just a byproduct, an inevitable consequence of us being attached to the Vine, having the full right to become children of God, and sealed by his Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-new-and-living-way&quot;&gt;A new and living way&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This verse Matthew 16:24 is not the basis of the new ministry of reconciliation, but the old ministry of condemnation. It should give any Christian a shudder had God not given us a new way to draw near to him through his Son. We’d find bodies of Christians strewn about as each attempts to obey its impossible command to make peace with God. Ah, but here’s the irony, had they tried to crucify themselves, to chop off their hands and feet, to pluck out their eyes, to sell all their possessions to give to the poor, they would have quickly discovered the futility of such attempts as they still wouldn’t know to what extent they must go to meet God’s righteous requirements. But thankfully:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Therefore, brothers, since we have confidence to enter the Most Holy Place by the blood of Jesus, by a &lt;strong&gt;new and living way&lt;/strong&gt; opened for us through the curtain, that is, &lt;strong&gt;his body&lt;/strong&gt; (Hebrews 10:19-20)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s his body, not ours. Go in peace.&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary type="text">Almost all Christians must have heard at least more than once sermons that encourage them to deny themselves, take up their cross, and follow Jesus as both a commandment and a promise that they would experience peace, joy, and ultimately a more fulfilling Christian life. Is this what Jesus had in mind when he spoke these words?</summary>

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“In him you also were circumcised - not, however, with a circumcision performed by human hands, but by the removal of the fleshly body, that is, through the circumcision done by Christ.  Having been buried with him in baptism, you also have been raised with him through your faith in the power of God who raised him from the dead (Colossians 2:11-12—NET).”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://vacsf.org/assets/images/putting-off-of-the-body-of-the-flesh-teaser.jpg&quot; style=&quot;border: 1px solid #cccccc; margin: 7px 15px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 148px; padding: 0px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;
An article of a similar topic was written previously under the title &lt;a href=&quot;http://vacsf.org/articles/Mortify-the-Deeds-of-the-Flesh/&quot;&gt;“Mortify The Deeds Of The Flesh.”&lt;/a&gt; This article is not a rewrite, but another look at it from a different angle based on a different verse. It is inspired from a sermon I heard at a Summer camp based on Colossians 2:11-12. During the sermon, the speaker refered to R. C. Sproul’s Coram Deo on the same verse. Interestingly, as I queried the world wide web to take the pulse of the general population in how they interpret these verses, R. C. Sproul’s Coram Deo on Colossians 2:11-12 showed up as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Our old Adamic nature has been mortally wounded, but it refuses to stay buried. Having a new nature in Christ, we must put sin to death when it rises up. This means that we must resist temptation and repent when we give in, for we will not be perfect until we are in heaven. Calvin comments on today’s passage that “burial expresses a continued process of mortification.” Sin is powerless to control us, but it is still dangerous and must be resisted.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;(excerpted from original article at: http://www.ligonier.org/learn/devotionals/dead-and-buried-with-christ/).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several key concepts in this Coram Deo of R. C. Sproul need to be checked against foundational truths found in Scriptures, and especially in the immediate context of the verses in question. These concepts are embraced by virtually all in Christianity though they’re unbiblical and can wreck havoc in the life of believers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mortally-wounded&quot;&gt;Mortally wounded&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Coram Deo: Our old Adamic nature has been mortally wounded, but it refuses to stay buried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know that we’re sinners not because of the sinful things that we do, or the good things that we fail to do, but because of what comes from deep inside: our sin nature. Whether or not we commit any of these sins, we’re sinners. Jesus said so himself: &lt;em&gt;“What defiles a person is not what goes into the mouth; it is what comes out of the mouth that defiles a person (Matthew 15:11).”&lt;/em&gt; Then how can it be that our sin nature is “mortally wounded” yet still manages to produce sins? No, our Adamic nature will never be completely dead until we as believers put on the incorruptible (1 Corinthians 15:52-54). Until then, it’s alive and well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, our Adamic nature is only mortally wounded in the sense that its sin no longer has the power to condemn us as we have been released from the law (Romans 7:6).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;put-sin-to-death&quot;&gt;Put sin to death&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Coram Deo continued: Having a new nature in Christ, we must put sin to death when it rises up. This means that we must resist temptation and repent when we give in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no doubt that any transgression causes great pain to both the transgressor and those who are in its path of destruction. With few exceptions, all Christians know the painful consequences of sins, and they know that should, and must, resist temptations. Even unbelievers know and are fearful of what price they have to pay when they fall. They don’t need to go to church to learn what even a child knows, as wisdom cries out in the marketplace (Proverbs 1:20).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about repentance in the context of the Coram Deo? By the time a sin had been committed, repentance would be useless. So is an apology as it would be just lip service. It’s better not to fall into sin at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Lord, however, provides us with a way to deal with sin in the event we fall into temptation. Not repentance, not remorse, not shedding of crocodile tears, not lip service of apology, but an assurance that our citizenship of God’s kingdom will still be in tact:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous (1 John 2:1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because we have Jesus, the Advocate, who sits besides God the Father to plead our case. What do you think is stronger? Our repentance or Jesus’ defense? Even our offering of ourselves to be nailed on a cross for our sins would be no match for the powerful defense of the Attorney-at-Law—as a matter of fact, God will not accept our own crucifixion on the cross as a substitution for our sins as none of us are “unblemished” enough to qualify. This is where God’s way is not our way is exemplified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, if our lifelong goal is to battle sins, we’d be fighting a losing battle, or going about it the wrong way. It’s infinitely better to fix our eyes on Christ than on our enemy the devil. I have a great real-life example to demonstrate this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a Christian sister at our church who works in the service industry. She asked me for an advise on how to deal with someone among her customers who frequently tried to seduce her. My advise to her was to fix her eyes on Jesus, to regularly come to Him to draw from Him strength that comes as a result of an assurance of her salvation, His unconditional love, His total forgiveness of her sins, and many other wonderful gifts that God gave her along with His Son.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now if she chose a different approach, the one suggested by the Coram Deo or common exhortations, she would, throughout the day, even while she is at home, prepare herself to say no to the temptation. She would most likely imagine herself being in the same situation, going through different scenarios, and so on so forth. Do you get the drift of where this is going? She would end up, in her mind, being with the man all day long even while she is at home. Is this the way you prepare yourself to resist temptations?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a child of God live, breath, and rest in their identity as children of God, as they set their minds on things above, they will be more ready to battle sins when they come. But if they are constantly thinking of sins, even thinking of how to resist sins, they will more likely fall when temptations do come, they will be like soldiers who are worn out from sleepless night worrying about their enemies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fix your eyes on Jesus then you will be more able to resist sins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the Israelites were bitten by snakes in the desert, God instructed Moses to hang a bronze snake on a pole so whoever lift up their eyes upon the snake after being bitten would not die. There was no need for Moses to remind folks to try to avoid getting snake bites, or to repent upon getting bitten, but that they just needed to lift up their eyes to behold the bronze snake. The bites are painful and deadly enough as a deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;…  if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous (1 John 2:1).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up: That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life (John 3:14-15).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;perfecting-the-self&quot;&gt;Perfecting the self&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Coram Deo continued: … for we will not be perfect until we are in heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This part of the Coram Deo says that our life’s purpose is to pursue perfection though we will not be able to reach it until we’re heaven. This idea of Christians working toward perfection is unbiblical in several aspects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, Jesus had stated in Matthew 5:48: &lt;em&gt;“Be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect,”&lt;/em&gt; which means if you’re not ALREADY perfect, you will not be ushered into God’s presence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, the apostle Paul also expressed his dismay in Galatians 3:3: &lt;em&gt;“Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh?”&lt;/em&gt; Having begun in the Spirit, having been born again from above, having what it takes to boldly enter the throne of grace, and you’re still trying to get more perfect through your flesh? By battling with your sin? Didn’t Christ already circumcise you? And if He already removed your corrupt nature (verse 11), which part of you is still not perfect? (Keep in mind that though you will still sin until the day you die, you’re perfect in God’s eyes as He sees you through His perfect Son)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, Hebrews 10:14 says this: &lt;em&gt;“For by one sacrifice he has made perfect forever those who are being made holy.”&lt;/em&gt; By one sacrifice, the sacrifice of the Lamb or God, not by the continual resisting or repenting in relation to sin. And if Christ already made you perfect forever then what are you perfecting?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these verses, and many more that can be found in Scriptures, point to the fact that our perfection is not arrived at through our personal effort in dealing with sin, but through what Christ did alone. All our effort in dealing with sins is like trying to deal with pimples while there is a cancerous corrupt nature inside that only Christ could deal with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;continued-process-of-mortification&quot;&gt;Continued process of mortification&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Coram Deo continued: Calvin comments on today’s passage that “burial expresses a continued process of mortification.” Sin is powerless to control us, but it is still dangerous and must be resisted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are we being buried alive? Being buried and continue to die? The Bible doesn’t say this is how we die. It says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Therefore we have been buried with him through baptism into death, in order that just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we too may live a new life (Romans 6:4).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have been buried with Christ. It’s a done deal. Furthermore:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Having been buried with him in baptism, you also have been raised with him through your faith in the power of God who raised him from the dead (Colossians 2:12).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This verse gives further clarification that we were not only buried with Christ, we died with Him, too, as no one can be raised unless he’s already dead. Jesus spoke of this truth in no uncertain terms:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Truly, truly, I tell you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains by itself alone. But if it dies, it bears much fruit (John 12:24).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The being raised back to life is implied here in the &lt;em&gt;“bears much fruit”&lt;/em&gt; part of the verse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These verses show us clearly that the “continued process of mortification” concept is not found at all in the Bible, yet we find it underlying messages virtually throughout Christiandom—or perhaps it is a milder version of purgatory? The Bible passages cited in this writing is, by no means exhaustive but sufficiently representative, to show gross misinterpretations and applications of Colossians 2:11-12 as a case in point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;in-conclusion&quot;&gt;In conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you notice the contrast between Colossians 2:11-12 and the Coram Deo?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Scripture passage conveys a sense of liberation, of triumph, with Christ as the prime mover in accomplishing the great task of taking away our sin nature. But most importantly, a sense of finality, that the work to present us as being ready to enter into the presence of the Most High, to boldly enter the throne of grace, has been accomplished. Christ the Giver, and us the recipients of an undeserved favor. Therefore we keep looking up to Christ the starter and the finisher of our faith.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Coram Deo projects something completely different. It tells us to engage in morbid introspection, to take our eyes off of Christ and focus on ourselves and the enemy of our souls. It tells us to go back to the desert as there are formidable giants in the promised land. It tells us that now is NOT the acceptable time, now is NOT the day of salvation (2 Corinthians 6:2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t believe in the Coram Deo, but believe in Colossians 2:11-12. Take it at its face value. There is now no longer a bronze snake, but there is Christ who sits on the right hand of God to plead your case that you are perfect—despite numerous snake bites. You were buried with Christ and now alive with Him in the newness of life. It’s done. It’s finished.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Before Jesus took his last breath on the cross, he said: &lt;em&gt;“It’s finished.”&lt;/em&gt; So just as God rested after he completed the work of creation, Jesus rested after he completed the work of saving man. It is his will that we enter this rest, yet so many Christians do not experience it, their walk with God is still weighed down with burdens as they try to achieve what only Jesus could achieve for them, and he had already done so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://vacsf.org/assets/images/entering-Gods-rest-teaser.jpg&quot; style=&quot;border: 1px solid #cccccc; margin: 7px 15px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 148px; padding: 0px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;
The burden that man must carry is both physical and spiritual, however, Jesus came to address mainly the later. Physical burden must be born by both believers and unbelievers alike, some enjoy a life of ease while others toil for their survival irrespective of spiritual condition. But when Jesus spoke the following well known verse: &lt;em&gt;“Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest” (Matthew 11:28)&lt;/em&gt;, was he not also talking about the physical burden, or perhaps at least together with the spiritual as well?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it is Jesus’ will to relieve us of our physical burden, such as ill health, financial issues, etc., he would have easily solved them through various physical means. If he could create the universe and everything in it, he could very well restore your good health, and give you resources to fix your financial problems. Jesus didn’t die to provide solutions to man’s physical problems, he died for their sins, and the guilt that weighed them down. Therefore the burden of man that must be lifted is the burden of sin which can only be accomplished by Christ on the cross on our behalf. This burden is uniquely a spiritual one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;religious-burden&quot;&gt;Religious burden&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Woe to you, experts in the law and you Pharisees, hypocrites! You cross land and sea to make one convert, and when you get one, you make him twice as much a child of hell as yourselves!” (Matthew 23:15)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pharisees make people children of hell not in the sense that they teach them to do evil things, or things against the law of God, but religious traditions which in reality drove them apart from him. They &lt;em&gt;“study the scriptures thoroughly because they think in them they possess eternal life, and it is these same scriptures that testify about Jesus” (John 5:39)&lt;/em&gt;. The scriptures became their god instead of the true God that the words pointed them to. In their mistaken notions, they pile the burden of the keeping of the law on believers, which in effect drives a wedge between them and God. The apostle Paul wrote clearly about this faulty belief as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A person is &lt;strong&gt;not justified by the works of the law, but by faith in Jesus Christ&lt;/strong&gt;. So we, too, have put our faith in Christ Jesus that we may be justified by faith in Christ and not by the works of the law, because &lt;strong&gt;by the works of the law no one will be justified&lt;/strong&gt; (Galatians 2:16).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, some may argue that they don’t preach the law for justification, but for sanctification. But the end result is the same, that though God may by his grace and mercies saves anyone who is in Christ, a believer’s life becomes a perpetual motion in trying to become “more sanctified,” to “please the Lord,” and even to meet expectations of others though oftentimes they are not at all based on any Biblical truths. Even demons believe certain things about God (James 2:19) but they’re far from having a trust relationship with God. Such is a relationship that many have with God. They view God through a lens almost universally held by all religions of the world. They see a God with expectations and goals that are impossible to achieve. They see a God who is ready to nail them for every little mistake they make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their burden is not physical, but purely a spiritual one. They always felt they needed to get right with God through the keeping of the law. We saw this in the book of Acts, when the apostles and leaders of the church in Jerusalem met to debate whether to impose the law of Moses on Gentile believers, the apostle Peter argued against it saying:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;Brothers, you know that some time ago God chose me to preach to the Gentiles so they would hear the message of the gospel and believe. &lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;And God, who knows the heart, has testified to them by giving them the Holy Spirit just as he did to us, &lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;and he made no distinction between them and us, cleansing their hearts by faith. &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;So now why are you putting God to the test by &lt;strong&gt;placing on the neck of the disciples a yoke that neither our ancestors nor we have been able to bear?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;On the contrary, we believe that we are saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus, in the same way as they are (Acts 15:7-11).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The burden that neither their ancestors nor they could bear. This was the type of burden that Jesus promised he would deliver us from. Therefore, the deliverance from the demand of the law was the “rest” that Jesus hinted at when he made the promise in Matthew 11:28. It was also this rest that the author of Hebrews 4:11 asks us to make every effort to enter into. And it is also this rest that God had given the Israelites in the form of the observance of the Sabbath day as a foreshadow of the true rest in Christ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;jesus-yoke-and-burden&quot;&gt;Jesus’ yoke and burden&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus’ yoke and burden is the cross and the sin of the world. When he asks us to take his yoke, he does not mean it in the same way most folks understand. His yoke is the cross that requires his death, and only his death is meaningful as it is the only sacrifice that can meet God’s requirement as the payment for the sin of the world. Therefore he could not have asked us to do the thing that only he could do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore to take up Jesus’ yoke can only mean to accept his free gift of the cross as if we ourselves died on the cross. This truth is presented in several passages in Scriptures that the death that was counted toward us was a done deal, that though we haven’t physically died, we are considered dead toward everything that Jesus died for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We were therefore buried with him&lt;/strong&gt; through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life (Romans 6:4).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;But now, &lt;strong&gt;having died&lt;/strong&gt; to what bound us, we &lt;strong&gt;have been released from the Law&lt;/strong&gt;, so that we serve in the new way of the Spirit, and not in the old way of the written code (Romans 7:6).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you noticed the past tense in these verses? We’re still alive and yet we were considered as buried with Christ, as having died and been released from the law. It’s the same way with the yoke that Jesus took and counted it toward us so our debt may be considered paid in full.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus paid it all so we may enter that precious rest that all of mankind have been longing for since the time of Adam. Jesus took the burden, the burden so huge that it encompasses all of the sins of man since the beginning of time and forevermore, so that we don’t have to bear it. The need to continually pay for each and every single sin of ours is now replaced by the once-for-all payment by the Son of God on the cross. Now those who accept Jesus’ payment as his own may rest. And this rest is not just a nice thing to have, it’s actually commanded to us in Scriptures:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Let us, therefore, make every effort to enter that rest (Hebrews 4:11).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effort we must make is not in doing something no matter how noble, but in trying to get into that place of rest. This is contrary to common belief in Christian living where the idea of rest is usually associated with laziness, with the abuse of God’s grace, and busyness is almost always exalted as a virtue. Hence the call to rest, as in the story of Mary and Martha where Jesus praised Mary for choosing the better thing, the resting at his feet, as the better choice that no one can take away from her, becomes a best kept secret, or to some others a heresy that must be banned from pulpits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it shouldn’t be a secret as our Redeemer talked about it often while he was here on earth. He talked about rest, about the setting of the captives free, about living water that satisfies forever, about burden lifted, and about the forgiveness of sin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;its-finished&quot;&gt;It’s finished&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no greater proclamation of the call to rest than what Jesus uttered on the cross at his final moment: &lt;em&gt;“It’s finished!” (John 19:30)&lt;/em&gt;. To the weary and heavily burdened who grew to understand what Jesus meant, this utterance is the split in the curtain that separated them from God, it’s the parting of the Red Sea, it’s the resurrection of the Christ, of the proclamation of the accessibility of the throne of grace, and of practical down-to-earth importance, it’s a huge boulder off their back that they can now stop trying to measure up to God’s impossible standard. Jesus did all that was needed by us to please God, or in other words, Jesus fulfilled all that God required of us to meet his standard of righteousness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are thereby permitted to lay your burden down, to stop trying to be “like God, knowing good and evil” and to start trusting in God who really knows good and evil, who not only knows what good for you to do and what bad for you to avoid but also to give you his creative power to accomplish his will as he has already prepared for you even before you were formed in your mother’s womb. The apostle Paul wrote this of himself that it was God who set him apart from his mother’s womb and called him by his grace to preach the gospel among the Gentiles (Galatians 1:15). What was Paul doing before this calling? Did he earnestly pray that God would call him into ministries? Did he prepare himself for the great task ahead? Did the church lay hands and pray upon him that God would use him mightily? None of the above. On the contrary, he was the enemy of the gospel. God did this to Paul, and to us, so that none among us can claim any credit toward any works of God, so that there would be no doubt in anyone’s mind that God is the author of all good works toward his kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter into God’s rest. It’s the better thing for you to choose and no one can take it away from you. It is the unfinished business with God, the unfinished business with sin and the law, that robs you of the peace, the abundant life, the living water, that Jesus promised you when he invited you to put your trust in him. Trust him. Your business with God, sin, and the law was finished, and Christ made sure of that at Calvary. You are no longer in debt. Come home and rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And they shall teach no more every man his neighbor, and every man his brother, saying, Know the LORD: for they shall all know me, from the least of them to the greatest of them, said the LORD: for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more (Jeremiah 31:34).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grace and peace be with you&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Many are concerned that the unlimitted teaching of grace will cause many to fall into antinomianism, and take advantage of the grace of God and find a license to sin. However Dr. Chalmers, an 18th century theologian, attempts to show us in his writing that such is not a case in the Christian experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dr-chalmers-on-the-gospel&quot;&gt;Dr. Chalmers on the gospel&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Thus it is, that &lt;strong&gt;the freer the Gospel, the more sanctifying&lt;/strong&gt; is the Gospel; and the more it is received as a doctrine of grace, the more will it be felt as a doctrine according to godliness.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This is one of the secrets of the Christian life, that &lt;strong&gt;the more a man holds of God, the greater is the payment of service&lt;/strong&gt; that he renders back again.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;On the tenure of “&lt;strong&gt;Do this and live&lt;/strong&gt;,” a spirit of fearfulness is sure to enter; and the jealousies of a legal bargain chase away all confidence from the intercourse between God and man; and the creature striving to be square and even with his Creator, is, in fact, pursuing all the while his own selfishness, instead of God’s glory; and with all the conformities which he labours to accomplish, the soul of obedience is not there, the mind is not subject to the law of God, nor indeed under such an economy ever can be.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;It is only when, as in the Gospel, acceptance is bestowed as a present, without money, and without price, that the security which man feels in God is placed beyond the reach of disturbance - or, that he can repose in Him, as one friend reposes in another - or, that any liberal and generous understanding can be established betwixt them - the one party rejoicing over the other to do him good - the other finding that the truest gladness of his heart lies in the impulse of a gratitude, by which it is awakened to the charms of a new moral existence.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Salvation by grace - salvation by free grace - salvation not of works, but according to the mercy of God - salvation on such a footing is not more indispensable to the deliverance of our persons from the hand of God’s justice, than it is to the deliverance of our hearts from the chill and the weight of ungodliness.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Retain a single shred or fragment of legality with the Gospel, and we raise a topic of distrust between man and God.  We take away from the power of the Gospel to melt and to conciliate.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;For this purpose, the freer it is, the better it is. That very peculiarity which so many dread as the germ of antinomianism, is, in fact, the germ of a new spirit, and a new inclination against it.  Along with the light of a free Gospel, there enters the love of the Gospel, which, in proportion as we impair the freeness, we are sure to chase away.  And never does the sinner find within himself so mighty a moral transformation, as when he is under the belief that he is saved by grace, for he feels constrained thereby to offer his heart a devoted thing, and to deny ungodliness.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-gospel-the-freer-the-more-sanctifying&quot;&gt;The Gospel, the freer the more sanctifying&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrary to conventional thinking which believes that the preaching of a free gospel will lead to folks finding licence to sin or excuse to abuse God’s grace, Dr Chalmers as well as I believe that a freer gospel will lead to more godliness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;do-this-and-live&quot;&gt;Do this and live&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Old Covenant can be summarized to the concept of “Do this and live,” carefully observing all the commandments written in the book of the law, &lt;em&gt;“Keep[ing] this Book of the Law always on your lips; meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do everything written in it. Then you will be prosperous and successful (Joshua 1:8).”&lt;/em&gt; Ironically the Bible calls this the law of sin and death, and in the same Romans 8:2 passage Paul suggest a new law of the Spirit of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the old law, there is fear, and there is jealousy as one is never certain of God’s acceptance, and in trying to repay God for what He’s done, the person become excessively obsessed toward self instead of God’s glory, and lastly though there is an appearance of obedience, it’s not from the heart, but from fear of punishment. Such is the nature of a “legal bargain” where everything must be earned and paid for. There is always the possibility that your performance is not good enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-more-a-man-holds-of-god-the-greater-the-payment-of-service&quot;&gt;The more a man holds of God, the greater the payment of service&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would probably not go as far as calling the work, that God has prepared beforehand for those who have come to Him by grace and through faith, a payment of service, but even if such a term is used, that God does indeed demand a payment, a man cannot pay more than what he received from God. &lt;em&gt;“The more a man holds of God”&lt;/em&gt;, as Dr Chalmers puts it, means the more he understands the height, depth, and breadth of God’s forgiveness through Christ, the full righteousness that he can be certain of as he puts his trust in Him, the freedom from all condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus, and the all things that God has given him along with His Son, the more he can be an instrument in the hand of God to do the work that is not based on the law, but on faith and purified by grace. In short, the more a man knows his &lt;a href=&quot;http://vacsf.org/articles/The-Will-of-God/&quot;&gt;inheritance in Christ&lt;/a&gt;, the more he can pay, not from the works of his flesh, but from the riches that God had already reserved for him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;acceptance-bestowed-as-a-present&quot;&gt;Acceptance bestowed as a present&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without money, and without price. Only then can there be security and true rest just like a friend is relaxed in the presence of another, and if there is anything the one does for the other, it is from a heart filled with gratitude. This is a new moral existence that is to be desired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;heart-that-knows-its-full-acceptance&quot;&gt;Heart that knows its full acceptance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As important as the truth of salvation by grace, it is of no less importance the deliverance of the heart from the fear and burden of our not being fully accepted by God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;if-there-is-but-a-single-shred-of-legality-with-the-gospel&quot;&gt;If there is but a single shred of legality with the gospel&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The power of the gospel lies in its ability to forgive man and to reconcile them with God, therefore if any amount of legality is implied in the gospel as it is presented, it will take away that power and causes serious distrust between a man and his God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-freer-the-better-is-the-gospel&quot;&gt;The freer the better is the gospel&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Chalmers says it best: “And never does the sinner find within himself so mighty a moral transformation, as when he is under the belief that he is saved by grace, for he feels constrained thereby to offer his heart a devoted thing, and to deny ungodliness.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;One mistranslated word can completely change the meaning of a verse. The mistranslation though may have been unintentional, it could reflect the theology of the translator; the implication can be profound, as it affects how people view their relationship with God, and consequently leads them astray.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-has-someone-become-a-sinner&quot;&gt;How has someone become a sinner?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://vacsf.org/assets/images/ephesians21-teaser.jpg&quot; style=&quot;border: 1px solid #cccccc; margin: 7px 15px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 148px; padding: 0px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;
There is almost always a great discrepancy between what a Christian believes theologically and what they believe in their heart which is reflected in the outworking of such belief. Their perception of the origin of their sin is what this article will address. This perception will in turn influence their understanding of the forgiveness of God which decidedly will characterize their relationship with God. The issue of sin and death is profoundly intertwined with forgiveness and life; if sin is misunderstood, so will it be with forgiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a previous article, &lt;a href=&quot;http://vacsf.org/articles/When-The-Son-Sets-You-Free/&quot;&gt;“When The Son Sets You Free”&lt;/a&gt;, I cited an example of a man who was practically dead in every way from the effect of drug addiction. He contributed nothing toward his eventual deliverance; all his effort to quit ended up in the desire for more, to the point he was so wasted that he was waiting for death to overtake him; if there was an inkling in his mind of a deity somewhere that he could pray to, he would, but he was too far gone to bother; he must have felt completely forsaken. So I quoted Ephesians 2:1 to illustrate God’s salvation to even one at such a dead state as him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As for you, you were dead in your transgressions and sins. (Ephesians 2:1)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far so good. This verse in the NIV translation, or in other translations such as KJV or NET that I often use, is fitting in describing the sad state that our drug addict was in before he was saved by the Lord. It can be universally applied to all men as &lt;em&gt;“all have sinned and fallen short of God’s glory (Romans 3:23).”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as I was confidently translating the aforementioned article into Vietnamese, I was in a bit of a shock to find the Vietnamese translation of Ephesians 2:1 saying something completely different from practically all the English versions. It says &lt;em&gt;“As for you, you were dead BECAUSE OF your transgressions and sins.”&lt;/em&gt;  I was quite taken aback upon reading such rendition of the verse. Would this mean if someone manages not to commit any transgressions or sins, they would not have been spiritually dead? That there is a possibility that there might be such a person who can defy the principle that all have sinned and fallen short of God’s glory?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually I must confess that there is a bit of malice in my thought as I discovered another such gross error in this translation; it proves my point that it is incumbent upon the reader of even such revered text as Scriptures to be vigilant in checking everything that is read against as many known and clear foundational truths as possible to avoid errors in interpretation or translation. The English versions simply help confirm the error in the Vietnamese translation, but even without them, the error is easily spotted if the reader is well equipped with a comprehensive set of basic truths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;contradicting-other-passages&quot;&gt;Contradicting other passages&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Vietnamese translation gives the impression that if someone can resolve to not commit the sins and trespasses, they can be spiritually alive, but both Romans 3:23 quoted above, and 1 John 1:8,10 says otherwise, that it is impossible for anyone to be without sins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If we claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us. … If we claim we have not sinned, we make him out to be a liar and his word is not in us. (1 John 1:8,10)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But let us revisit the problematic Vietnamese translation of the verse so we won’t lose track of why we get here: &lt;em&gt;“As for you, you were dead BECAUSE OF your transgressions and sins.”&lt;/em&gt;  We know from the very basic understanding of the gospel that we are dead not because of the things that we do—the bad things that we do or the good things that we fail to do—, but because of who we are: sinners in need of God’s grace and mercies. We’re sinners even if we haven’t committed any sins common to man, as it is written in Romans 5:12-14:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, and in this way death came to all men, because all sinned – for before the law was given, sin was in the world. But sin is not taken into account when there is no law. Nevertheless, death reigned from the time of Adam to the time of Moses, even over those who did not sin by breaking a command, as did Adam, who was a pattern of the one to come.” (Romans 5:12-14)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;being-dead-versus-being-alive&quot;&gt;Being dead versus being alive&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the Vietnamese translation of Ephesians 2:1 holds true, people are only spiritually dead when they commit certain sins or trespasses, so when they don’t sin, assuming it’s possible, or that they have adequately paid for their sins—through means such as confession which I don’t believe they can—, they’re spiritually alive. This assumption also runs against the truth put forth in Scriptures about what makes sinners come alive: the indwelling Spirit  who is given to believers upon their faith in Christ. Let’s keep in mind that it’s their faith in Christ that counts, not their ability to resist sins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the mindset of the Vietnamese version of Ephesians 2:1, believers are like a yo-yo in their being dead and alternately being alive, as often as in their sinning and not sinning. This pattern of life may be reasonable under the Old Covenant, but it’s no longer so under the New Covenant. Under the old, the offering for the remission of sin was repeated over and over again because sin was never completely erased, but under the new, Christ was offered once for all and never to be repeated again. So for those who were dead and brought back to life through the faith in Christ, and if they, &lt;em&gt;“BECAUSE OF”&lt;/em&gt; their sins and trespasses, become dead again, and since Christ cannot be crucified again, how are they to become alive again? Through confessions of their sins? No, this cannot be, since &lt;em&gt;“without the shedding of blood, there is no remission of sins.”&lt;/em&gt; (Hebrews 9:22).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reverting-back-to-the-old-way&quot;&gt;Reverting back to the old way&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mistranslation of Ephesians 2:1 is not simply an error in translation, it’s emblematic of man’s tendency to rely on the flesh no matter what Bible versions, hence their reliance on the keeping of the law to walk with God. This is also reflected in the misinterpretation of many passages of Scriptures though they may have been correctly translated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Christ died once for all for sin, a believer also becomes alive in the Spirit once for all as they entered the trust relationship with God in Christ.  The faulty belief causes them to doubt the assurance of salvation, as they think their sins and trespasses cause them to die again, and so they’re thrown back into the loop of trying to find remedy for their sins, with “sin confession” as one among many means to ease their guilty conscience. And so they’re sent back to the desert for a complete and symbolic forty years of desert of frustration and toil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;correct-translation-of-ephesians-21&quot;&gt;Correct translation of Ephesians 2:1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As for you, you were dead in your transgressions and sins. (Ephesians 2:1)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The English translation is already correct. You were dead, just as Adam and Eve of old were dead, just like the rest of mankind who were born in corruptible flesh. All your transgressions and sins were but inevitable fruit of your flesh in which you are struggling until the day the Lord gives you an incorruptible flesh (1 Corinthians 15).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Matthew 5:48 says this about God: &lt;em&gt;‘Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.’&lt;/em&gt; Therefore, if Christ hasn’t already made you perfect, when will you be? One more revival meeting? One more communion? One more Bible verse to memorize? One more soul to win for Christ? No, if you aren’t already perfectly acceptable to God, you will never be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://vacsf.org/assets/images/addiction-teaser.jpg&quot; style=&quot;border: 1px solid #cccccc; margin: 7px 15px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 148px; padding: 0px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;
What does a human heart need? What drives a person to seek relief in work, alcohol, drug, gambling, or various other forms of addiction? The mathematician and philosopher Blaise Pascal shared his understanding that there is a God-shaped vacuum in the human heart, which is really not far from the truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Bible contains roughly 500 instances of an attribute of God that is described as love, grace, mercies, compassion, or other forms of it, and 1 John 4:8 declares that God is Love. Then it stands to reason that what the aforementioned relief seekers really need is love, which is the nature of God, but they found only a temporary relief that not only didn’t last, but may even wreck their lives and the lives of those that love them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God is doing amazing things in Vietnam in healing and restoring young people whose lives had been wrecked by drug addiction. These addicts, tried as they may, they could not wrest themselves from the powerful grip of an ill that destroys both mind and body, but it was there that God’s saving grace shone ever more brightly. Once they found hope at a Christian recovery center in Vietnam, the Word of God, as they started to learn and memorize it, began to heal their minds and subsequently their bodies in such a way we could not describe as anything but miracles. All these recovered addicts virtually spoke in unison that it was God’s love, and their knowledge of it, that saved them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article will cite a testimony, one out of dozens of recorded testimonies, and perhaps hundreds of other unspoken ones, of a man who was delivered from drug addiction as a demonstration of salvation by God’s grace, then suggest that it must be by that same grace that the recovered addict must walk until their journey on earth is done. The temptation to go back to the law, hence the reliance on the strength of the flesh, is strong, and once the saved-by-grace Christian unknowingly falls back to walking by the flesh, they will find their yoke to be anything but easy  and their burden anything but light. Sadly this is the story of many Christians, and this article hopes to point them to a better way to enjoy the life that is supposed to be as abundant as Jesus had promised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;Portrait of a drug addict&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I’m the second child in a family of five siblings. I was born in 19__ in Hanoi, Vietnam, into a family of crime. My childhood was filled with pain and sorrow. Being a son of a criminal, I was rejected by my peers. These negative experiences filled the heart of an innocent child with so much pain and sorrow beyond his years. I was ashamed of my father, and hatred began to fill my heart. Then I found the next logical thing to do was to quit school and join the gang, following my father’s footsteps. The saying “the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree” was fulfilled when my brothers, similarly one after another followed the crime filled path of the family.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2&gt;Life in the gang&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I dove into the street life, getting addicted to cocaine and heroin, becoming a thief, a robber, a debt collector, a killer for hire, a drug pusher, and a pimp. I would persuade girls who just left the countryside for the big city to become prostitutes. Those who never had any experience with drugs, I let them try so they became addicts and subjected under my control. I had to pay for such sinful lifestyle with years in prison. But prison could not change me. I became even more violent and committed even more crimes upon leaving prison. Each action that followed was worse than the last. Then came the last time, in 2010, when I was released to return to my family after six years in prison. But upon returning home I lost all hope to live and survive. My whole family was broken. Some of my brothers were addicted to drugs, some were in prison. My mother was always drinking, gambling, and had no care nor love for anyone else. My wife left and re-married. I heard from someone that before she married another husband, she gave my only son away to some temple.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2&gt;Hoping to die&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;When I was in so much pain and lost all hope to live, I thought of my family, of my son, of the years in prison, and the years being addicted to drugs. I no longer wanted to live like that anymore, but I was at a dead end without an escape. In utter despair, I decided to seek an end to my life. I thought death would be the solution  to all my problems. A drug overdose seemed to be a possible solution. I then hired a motorbike taxi driver, giving him 500,000 dong (equivalent to $25 USD at the time) to buy me a powerful drug and a syringe for my suicide attempt.  However a strange thing happened as I did not die. Someone told me later that they found me already clinically dead with pupils was dilated, so they called for transportation to take me to the emergency room of a hospital. The doctors tried to resuscitate me without success. Then they announced that I was dead and transferred my body to the morgue. In the middle of the night, I woke up finding myself inside the hospital’s morgue. When I walked out, everyone was terrified thinking they had seen a ghost.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2&gt;Seeking death again&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, upon returning home, I still had no desire to live. I sought to find death once again. I locked myself in a private room with several hundred liters of liquor which I bought and put in a large container. For a straight two months and seventeen days, I did not see anyone, ate nothing except drinking alcohol. At the end of this period, there was only skin and bone left on my body. The muscles of my arms and legs had shrunken, and I was immobilized. I released bodily wastes in the same place where I stayed. I thought perhaps I would have only a few more days to live.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2&gt;My life raft&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Right around this time, my cousin who worked at the  Binh Long rehabilitation center headed by Pastor Si Tan Ngo, had some time off so he came to pay me a visit. Seeing me in my condition, he broke into tears and said, “Hai, there is one way you can be saved.” “Which way is that?” I asked. And he answered, “Follow Jesus. He saved me from sins and drugs.” Though at that moment I knew nothing about God, I told him, “Yes, let me go with you.” But during that time, I was nearly paralyzed and could not travel to Binh Long in the South. Then my cousin brought Mrs. Hoan who was Nam Quoc Trung’s mother, together with Minh Ngoc Nguyen to come and pray with me to accept Christ and then brought me to Bac Giang rehabilitation center.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2&gt;Christ entered my life&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I arrived in Bac Giang on December 17, 2010. I could never forget Christmas that year as it was the first time I came to the Bac Giang rescue center. It was the Christmas that  Jesus entered my life. I was unable to move about independently due to the two months and seventeen days without food except alcohol which caused me to suffer from mental collapse and physical weakness. Upon arrival at the center, I was brought into the prayer room, and I was awakened at the sight of a board with lyrics of the hymn “When a Child is Born” written on it. The words of the hymn broke my heart, and I mumbled and wept while singing, and kept repeating the verse,&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 5%;&quot;&gt;“A ray of hope flitters in the sky. A shiny star lights up way up high. All across the land dawns a brand new morn. This comes to pass when a child is born”.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Surely the lyrics of this hymn reflected my life, a life filled with darkness, without happiness, and without hope. But for loving me Jesus came. He is the bright light, the joy and the hope of my life.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2&gt;The recovery&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When I first arrived at the center, I was very weak, with a body weight of only about 84 lbs. I figured it would take at least six months before I could recover. But the fearful and wonderful thing was God had fully restored me, healing me in both body and mind in only a month and a half. A miracle indeed!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2&gt;Living with gratitude&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I am eternally grateful for all Jesus Christ had done for me. Were it not for Him to seek me out and save me, I would have been buried six feet under.  Since following Christ until now, there are still things in my life that still leave much to be desired, but thanks to His mercies, love and grace, He continues to forgive and lift me up. He pours His love upon me and uses me in loving and caring for the other addicts when they were first admitted to the center. I truly rejoice upon seeing them overcoming the effect of drug withdrawal, experiencing healing, and a new life in the name of Jesus. I share the joy with their parents, spouses, and children… the kind of joy that I had never known before. My hope and desire is God would use the remainder of my life to bring salvation to those being imprisoned and chained by addictions and sins like I was. So they may also experience new and blessed lives when Jesus enters their hearts. All glory be to God. Amen!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;saved-by-grace&quot;&gt;Saved by grace&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not difficult to convince anyone of the fact that this man was saved from a life of drug addiction by God’s grace, and likewise his deliverance from a sin nature which is infinitely more formidable than the power of drugs. But it’s not easy to prove to the overwhelming majority in Christianity that they are to live by God’s grace as well. Let’s quickly trace our drug addict’s journey to the light to set the stage for the case for living by God’s grace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How did this man escape the grip of drug addiction? Through sheer determination? Through obedience? Through repentance after each painful failure? Through gradual reduction of drug use? Prayer? No, he didn’t do any of the above, or perhaps he tried but failed. He was on a downward spiral to the point he attempted suicide twice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the second suicide attempt, we read that this man locked himself in a room for two months and seventeen days with hundreds of liters of liquor with the intention of drowning himself in it. Can you imagine the depth of his despair? The depression that was his darkest of nights? He was like a lost member in the valley of dry bones in Ezekiel 37. Though this man’s heart was still beating weakly inside his body of skin and bones, he was practically dead. Hope, if he had any, was all but lost, for if he had a fleeting thought of it, he’d have prayed, but this seemingly easy act of praying never made it out of his mouth. The end was so near, just a few more days, so he thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then out of the blue, perhaps by divine providence that a cousin who was working for a rehab center came to pay him a visit at that critical moment when he was hovering at the edge of oblivion. And as they say the rest is history, our addict was on his road to recovery. Ephesians 2:1 and Romans 5:8 were demonstrated in his life so beautifully:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As for you, you were dead in your trespasses and sins. (Ephesians 2:1)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us. (Romans 5:8)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This man was definitely dead in … drugs, yet Christ died for him two thousand years ago so that today he might live. His conversion, though more dramatic than most, obeys the same principle spelled out in such verses as Ephesians 2:8-9: &lt;em&gt;“For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—not by works, so that no one can boast.”&lt;/em&gt; Just as he was saved by faith, and not by the works of his efforts to quit drugs, so was he saved from spiritual death through that same faith, and not by the works of avoiding sins. If it was impossible for him to achieve freedom from addiction with his own strength, it would be infinitely more impossible for him to achieve freedom from his sin nature, by trying to avoid sinning at all cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though most Christian do not struggle with drugs like our man in the story, they do struggle with sins in general, with other forms of addiction like work, alcohol, gambling, jealousy, self pity, low self esteem, pornography, and myriad such vices. To them the struggles are just as severe as drug addiction. If the drug addict cannot wrest himself from his depraved condition, neither can they. What they all need is the power of God, not their own strength as no amount of it is enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, at this point, we have established that our recovered drug addict contributed nothing toward his salvation. Does it then stand to reason that he likewise will not be able to contribute anything toward his sanctification? If his flesh couldn’t cleanse the drugs from his system, how will it ever make him holy enough to meet God?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-joy-of-salvation&quot;&gt;The joy of salvation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most testimonies end right about here, and this man’s testimony is no exception. But in reality, here is where the story really begins. The initial moment of joy of salvation will quickly recede into the background to yield to a state of normalcy that will endure for perhaps decades until one’s journey on earth is done. But it is during this post-salvation phase that one’s root grows deep into the faith that began at the moment of repentance. There is no exception. The initial joy of salvation must transition into something more abiding, something that does not depend on transitory feelings, be they tears of joy or songs of praise or blessings received, but on something that is immovable, that will endure forever; something that is based on the character of God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, many new Christians fall into the trap of trying to hang on to this initial moment as a standard that they must measure all subsequent experiences against. The normalcy of daily humdrum become suspect that one might have fallen from grace. So the recovered addict, or the babe in Christ who had a first taste of God’s grace and mercies, frantically engages himself in activities that might propel him back to that state that may not necessarily be experienced again. They mistakenly believe that the initial joy of salvation is a measure of how God loves and accept them, hence they deduce that a decline from such emotional high is a sign that God is no longer pleased with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-different-addiction&quot;&gt;A different addiction?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is our new Christian to do? The experience he just had became a golden standard against which he must now evaluate everything. But the joy he felt, the new found freedom he just experienced, the clarity of mind that came as a result of a euphoric encounter with the divine, and many other wonderful benefits since he came to Christ, are becoming increasing elusive. In a frantic quest to get back to that wonderful beginning, our new Christian tried to get busy with everything that made sense to him in the hope of restoring the joy that has begun to fade away. Bible study, books, revival meetings, giving of testimonies, and anything that a typical Christian would do. But despite occasional moments of riding high on wings of eagle, the burden seems to get heavier with increasing efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it possible that our recovered addict had found a different addiction to replace a previous one, albeit the new addiction is not nearly as harmful as the drug-based one but still shares the common purpose of masking an inner pain and emptiness? At this point our recovered addict is now experiencing the same struggles that many Christians face on a daily basis. The initial miracles though had helped launch the new believer on a fresh start, it got him on one traveled by the rest of mankind; he’s still in the end a sinner saved by the grace of God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;trying-to-finish-by-human-efforts&quot;&gt;Trying to finish by human efforts?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recovered addict will fare no better than someone who comes to Christ in a much less dramatic fashion, in how they should live out the remainder of their lives. The irony is, drug addicts or not, though virtually all entered the kingdom of God by grace and through faith with no claim of personal merits or efforts, they all ended up reverting back to the trusting of the flesh to walk the rest of the way. The apostle Paul expressed his frustration and anger at such stupidity like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;You foolish Galatians! Who has cast a spell on you? Before your eyes Jesus Christ was vividly portrayed as crucified! &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;The only thing I want to learn from you is this: Did you receive the Spirit by doing the works of the law or by believing what you heard? &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Are you so foolish? Although you began with the Spirit, are you now trying to finish by human effort? &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;Have you suffered so many things for nothing? if indeed it was for nothing. &lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;Does God then give you the Spirit and work miracles among you by your doing the works of the law or by your believing what you heard? (Galatians 3:1-6)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You began with the Spirit, solely by trusting in Christ through God’s grace, now you’re working hard to get to the finish line? The apostle Paul calls that foolishness. It takes but a fraction of a second for someone to be saved, like this prayer &lt;em&gt;“Jesus, remember me when you come in your kingdom” (Luke 23:43)&lt;/em&gt;. But walking with God from that point on may be a long time. So if you needed to rely 100% on God’s grace and His life-giving Spirit in your 100-yard dash—and it wasn’t even a dash as you were supposed to be already dead like the drug addict in our story—to become a Christian, how in the world are you now running a marathon relying on something else, something that comes from your own merits and ability and myriad other self-exalting attributes?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the principal cause for dissatisfaction in the lives of most Christians. They started out from nothing, but they now look inward and rely on their own ability to walk the rest of the way. They started out looking up to the Savior to save them from the bottomless pit of sins, or drug addiction as in the case of our man in this story, now they look within themselves to see if there is anything they can muster up to carry them on until they reach the finish line. This reverting back to the strength of the flesh is the root of all evil that wrecks havoc in the life of believers. It is not the drug addict’s relapses that make them fall from grace, it’s his self righteousness that is his true enemy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sin-empowered-by-the-law&quot;&gt;Sin empowered by the law&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why do people go back to the reliance on the flesh that was dead in sins  before they came to Christ, the same flesh that was useless against the power of drugs as in the case of our drug addict, and the flesh that is useless to the rest of mankind in providing them the righteousness they need to become citizens of the kingdom of God?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The root cause of this pervasive problem is the lack of a full understanding of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://vacsf.org/articles/Understanding-Forgiveness/&quot;&gt;forgiveness&lt;/a&gt; that Christ accomplished for them on the cross. Though they can correctly answer all questions in a theological examination, what they know in their hearts is far from what they say they believe.  They don’t really understand the meaning of what Jesus said before he took his last breath on the cross: &lt;em&gt;“It’s finished.”&lt;/em&gt; To them there are more sins to be forgiven, more work to be done before they can meet God. Though they accept the truth that Jesus died once-for-all for all the sins of mankind on the cross, they still fear that God is still holding their sins against them, that they’re not good enough to meet God yet, and countless other reasons for their feeling inadequate in their relationship with their Lord.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What then is the purpose of Christ’s death on the cross? What is the meaning of Christ’s dying once for all for all the sins of mankind? What did he mean when he said: “It’s finished”? I’m sure most Christians know the answers to these questions, but what they cannot reconcile, or rather what they don’t dare to place their full trust in, is the full resolution to the problem of sin at the cross, now and forevermore, that Christ’s death had given them a full right to become children of God, to be citizens of his kingdom, friends of God, to be considered blameless in his eyes, and everything else that is included in God’s promise: &lt;em&gt;“He who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all–how will he not also, along with him, graciously give us ALL THINGS?” (Romans 8:32)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And best of all, the ALL-THINGS includes the very presence of God indwelling in the hearts of all who call on the name of Jesus. Can you imagine God in you, the Holy Spirit in you, and Christ in you the hope of glory? And if God is in you, why in the world do you try to &lt;em&gt;“finish by human efforts”&lt;/em&gt; (Galatians 3:3)? Why do you try to “perfect” what Christ had already completed?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This lack of trust in the all-sufficiency of Christ has driven them back into the arm of the law as they hope that their obedience will make them right with God. But there is a catch. For there is no amount of obedience, of good works, of self sacrifices, will bridge that gap between a sense of lacking, of not having arrived, and a sense of rest, of knowing that God has fully accepted them and ready to receive them into the kingdom of God. On the other hand, The only thing that can bridge the gap is the work that Christ had already done on the cross. This work is not a continuing process, like sacrifices to be repeated over and over again, but a once-for-all act that makes you perfect in God’s sight. You will still sin, as a matter of fact you may fall back into drug addiction, not once but seventy times seven, yet God will always behold you through His beloved Son: &lt;em&gt;“This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. (Matthew 3:17)”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matthew 5:48 says this about God: &lt;em&gt;“Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.”&lt;/em&gt; Therefore, if Christ hasn’t already made you perfect, when will you be? One more revival meeting? One more communion? One more Bible verse to memorize? One more soul to win to Christ? No, if you aren’t already perfectly acceptable to God, you will never be. Today, you can claim Jesus’ promise to the thief on the cross: &lt;em&gt;“Truly I tell you, today you will be with me in paradise.” (Luke 23:43)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;you-will-be-free-indeed&quot;&gt;You will be free indeed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is how you walk with God after that wondrous encounter that brought you back from the dead. That no matter how you feel, or perform while still in the flesh, God’s love and acceptance of you will be the same yesterday, today, and forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;He who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus. (Phillipians 1:6)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Are we ever more in danger of teaching an error, than when we are combatting one? For when a teacher has the ‘antinomians’ in his sights, I find he often becomes a proponent of increased endeavour, talking of the ‘necessities’ required in a ‘holy’ life, instead of rather the holy inevitabilities to be expected in the regenerate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://vacsf.org/assets/images/danger-teaser.jpg&quot; style=&quot;border: 1px solid #cccccc; margin: 7px 15px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 148px; padding: 0px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;
He talks about the necessity of obeying God’s Word, instead of the inevitability, in the truly regenerate, of living it.  ‘Only holiness brings full joy’, one says.  But isn’t that putting the cart before the horse?  Isn’t it rather;  ‘Only joy (in believing), brings genuine holiness’?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Observe how the noted theologian quoted below takes verses of Scripture that describe the intention and purpose of the sovereign God, and render them as being contingent, and thereby provisional, and thereby uncertain, contingent upon the required actions of Man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New Testament tells us that we were chosen, redeemed, and called to be holy.  The Father &quot;chose us in him [Christ] before the creation of the world to be holy and blameless in his sight&quot; (Eph. 1:4). &quot;Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her to make her holy... to present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other blemish, but holy and blameless&quot; (Eph. 5:25- 27). &quot;It is God&#39;s will that you should be holy.... God did not call us to be impure, but to live a holy life&quot; (1 Thess. 4:3,7).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But who is the prime mover here?  God is!  Has the antinomian heresy turned a Calvinist theologian into an Arminian one?!  He so quickly forgets that life does not manifest itself because of requirements imposed upon it, but life manifests that life-principle which has been implanted within, by its creator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He continues;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sanctification is not an option, but an integral part of the salvation package, just as the repentance and consecration that lead into the pursuit of holiness are integral to the response for which the gospel calls. God&#39;s plan is to save us from sin, not in sin; therefore the need for holiness must be acknowledged and accepted.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sanctification is indeed an integral part of the ‘salvation package’, but are praise for some parts of the “package” to be due to God, and some parts due to Man?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The necessity of holiness follows from the revealed conditions of assurance. No one has a right to believe that they are partakers of God&#39;s salvation unless they walk the path of conscious, purposeful obedience and service to God. In 2 Peter 1:3-11 we learn that progress in sanctification is the only way to make one&#39;s calling and election sure (that is, to make certain of it).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, our antinomian antagonist rushes to turn what is the ‘election according to grace’ into an election according to the required conditions!    The verses he quotes do not show us how to ensure our election, but reveal what fruit shall indubitably be found in the elect. The inevitable fruits of regeneration are enumerated in Scripture as encouragements to some, and warnings to others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isaiah’s words (61:1-3) are just so evocative of our deliverance from the guilt and imprisonment of the law, into the joy of the new fruitful life God has created within us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon Me, because the LORD has anointed Me To preach good tidings to the poor; He has sent Me to heal the broken-hearted, To proclaim liberty to the captives, And the opening of the prison, to those who are bound;  To proclaim the acceptable year of the LORD, And the day of vengeance of our God; To comfort all who mourn,  To console those who mourn in Zion, To give them beauty for ashes, The oil of joy for mourning, The garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; That they may be called trees of righteousness, The planting of the LORD, that He may be glorified.” (Isaiah 61:1-3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Lord Jesus came to perform these promises, He said, and here is wonderfully revealed not merely His purpose, but also His method, which method is, He has made us His planting.  He has planted us as ‘trees of righteousness’, and just as an apple seed will surely produce an apple tree, so surely will those He has planted in righteousness, grow into trees of righteousness, leading to the eternal glorifying of His name.  There are no requirements demanded of Man here.  Here is the sovereign purpose, and certain joy of God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Truly;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Who has first given to Him, And it shall be repaid to him?”  For of Him, and through Him, and to Him, are all things,  to whom, be glory forever. Amen. (Romans 11:35-36)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;LORD, You will establish peace for us, For You have done all our works in us. (Isaiah 26:12)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them. (Ephesians 2:10)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Not unto us, O LORD, not unto us, But to Your name give glory. (Psalm 115:1)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article was written by AFJ, a retired pastor who is still serving God in his part of the world. One day, AFJ found this website on the Internet and we became great friends due to our common understanding of what it means to be followers of Christ. This article is really an entire email that AFJ sent me perhaps as an affirmation of my writings so I won’t lose heart in this endeavor. Thank you brother AFJ. I have learned much from you.&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary type="text">Are we ever more in danger of teaching an error, than when we are combatting one? For when a teacher has the ‘antinomians’ in his sights, I find he often becomes a proponent of increased endeavour, talking of the ‘necessities’ required in a ‘holy’ life, instead of rather the holy inevitabilities to be expected in the regenerate.</summary>
