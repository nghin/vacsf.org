&lt;p&gt;The Book of Hebrews, found in the New Testament of the Christian Bible, is a remarkable and deeply theological work that addresses an early Christian audience, particularly those of Jewish background. Although the author of Hebrews remains anonymous, the text is notable for its emphasis on the superiority of Jesus Christ and the New Covenant over the Old Covenant and the Judaic religious traditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hebrews serves as a bridge between the Old and New Testaments, drawing on rich Jewish traditions while explaining the transformative nature of Jesus as the ultimate high priest and the fulfillment of God’s promises. The book eloquently presents the theme of Christ’s supremacy, portraying Him as the mediator of a superior covenant and the ultimate source of salvation. Throughout its chapters, Hebrews offers profound theological insights, practical exhortations, and encouragement to its readers, emphasizing the vital role of faith and perseverance in the face of trials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book, with its unique and profound perspective on the role of Jesus in the Christian faith, continues to be a source of inspiration and spiritual insight for believers seeking a deeper understanding of the relationship between the Old and New Covenants in the context of their faith.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Gospel of John is often given to new believers or unbelievers, but it presents a challenge as most of its content still resides within the realm of the Old Covenant. A significant portion of Jesus’ teachings, particularly the parables, were shrouded in concealed meanings. Fortunately, our class has extensively explored the New Covenant through Paul’s epistles, equipping us to revisit John’s gospel with the necessary tools to interpret the numerous hints Jesus provided about future events following his crucifixion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a second study of this book as we go through it verse by verse in our Sunday School class. The difference now is we have a far firmer knowledge of the New Covenant and the underlying foundational truths that form the basis of our understanding. I pray that the information in this study will help you to have a joyful relationship with Christ and a testimony that accurately captures your abundant life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://vacsf.org/assets/images/blasphemy-against-the-holy-spirit-teaser.jpg&quot; style=&quot;border: 0px none; margin: 7px 15px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 148px; padding: 0px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;“&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;Then they brought to him a demon-possessed man who was blind and mute. Jesus healed him so that he could speak and see. &lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;All the crowds were amazed and said, “Could this one be the Son of David?” &lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;But when the Pharisees heard this they said, “He does not cast out demons except by the power of Beelzebub, the ruler of demons!” ... &lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;For this reason I tell you, people will be forgiven for  every sin and blasphemy, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven. &lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt;Whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven. But whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come. (Matthew 12:22-32)”&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are your thoughts after reading the above verse or hearing a sermon on its meaning and applications? Most people believe that to &lt;em&gt;“blaspheme”&lt;/em&gt; is to use foul language or disrespectful words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;blasphemy-against-the-holy-spirit&quot;&gt;BLASPHEMY AGAINST THE HOLY SPIRIT&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people believe that blasphemy against the Holy Spirit is related to attributing God’s miracle to the devil after reading the passage above. This assumption, however, will cause problems for those who want to question the signs and wonders they see. In Matthew&lt;br /&gt;
24:24, Jesus warns us about this potential problem:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“For false messiahs and false prophets will appear and perform great signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who will dare to question the authenticity of the false prophets’ signs and wonders if they are so real that they can even deceive the saved, and they are afraid of committing blasphemy against the Holy Spirit?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;jesus-is-charged-with-blasphemy&quot;&gt;JESUS IS CHARGED WITH BLASPHEMY&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We should be thankful that there is a Biblical example of the &lt;em&gt;“blasphemy”&lt;/em&gt; accusation so that we can use it as a model to interpret its use in Matthew 12:22-32.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is written as follows in John 10:30-33:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“&lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt;Jesus replied, “ … The Father and I are one. &lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;The Jewish leaders picked up rocks again to stone him to death. &lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt;Jesus said to them, “I have shown you many good deeds from the Father. For which one of them are you going to stone me?” &lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt;The Jewish leaders replied, “We are not going to stone you for a good deed but for blasphemy, because you, a man, are claiming to be God.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The term &lt;em&gt;“blasphemy,”&lt;/em&gt; which is translated from the Greek word βλασφημία, is used in both Matthew 12:31 and John 10:33. In John 10:33, the Jewish leaders accused Jesus of &lt;em&gt;“blasphemy”&lt;/em&gt; because he was &lt;em&gt;“a man claiming to be God.”&lt;/em&gt; As a result, someone claiming to be the Holy Spirit must commit blasphemy against the Holy Spirit. We can broaden its meaning to include anyone who takes on the role of the Holy Spirit, stands in his place to perform a specific function, claims to have the same power as him, or does something similar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-true-meaning-of-this-sin&quot;&gt;THE TRUE MEANING OF THIS SIN&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most Christians agree that the Holy Spirit serves as an intercessor, a seal of redemption, to lead them into all truth, to give eternal life (just as God gave Adam his spirit so he could become a living being), a comforter, one who convicts the world of sin, one who communicates God’s will to believers, one who bestows wisdom, one who bestows gifts, one who bears fruit, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, blasphemy against the Holy Spirit must be committed by someone or a system of belief that attempts to play the role of the Holy Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;who-can-commit-this-sin&quot;&gt;WHO CAN COMMIT THIS SIN?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, there are numerous ways for someone to attempt to play the role of the Holy Spirit. There are already many religious leaders with large followings appearing in churches all over the world. They also spread many false beliefs, which may cause believers to abandon the faith they once held. As a result, it is critical for believers to be deeply rooted in the gospel of grace of the Lord Jesus Christ in order to recognize false teachers or false beliefs when they appear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, most of the Pauline letters, in my opinion, show that the most difficult issue for believers is the ability to distinguish between law and grace, faith and works. Jesus used many parables to inform us of these differences ahead of time, but they remained hidden until revealed to Paul so that he could explain them to us in the New Testament.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-law-and-the-holy-spirit&quot;&gt;THE LAW AND THE HOLY SPIRIT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many passages compare the roles of the law and the Holy Spirit. As an example: &lt;em&gt;“It is the Lord who made us adequate to be servants of a new covenant not based on the letter but on the Spirit, for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.” (2 Corinthians 3:6)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The word &lt;em&gt;“letter”&lt;/em&gt; in the preceding verse refers to the law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“For the law of the life-giving Spirit in Christ Jesus has set you free from the law of sin and death.” (Romans 8:2)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“For when we were in the flesh, the sinful desires, aroused by the law, were active in the members of our body to bear fruit for death.” (Romans 7:5)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“But if the ministry that produced death – carved in letters on stone tablets – came with glory, so that the Israelites could not keep their eyes fixed on the face of Moses because of the glory of his face (a glory which was made ineffective) how much more glorious will the ministry of the Spirit be?” (2 Corinthians 3:7)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The phrase &lt;em&gt;“ministry that produced death”&lt;/em&gt; was used in the preceding passage to describe Moses’ ministry of delivering the Ten Commandments from Mount Sinai to the Israelites. This ministry was compared to the Holy Spirit’s live giving ministry. The verses above were used to demonstrate that those who rely on the works of the law to live out their Christian lives may have committed the sin of blasphemy against the Holy Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d like to finish with the following two verses:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I do not set aside God’s grace, because if righteousness could come through the law, then Christ died for nothing!” (Galatians 2:21)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“You who are trying to be declared righteous by the law have been alienated from Christ; you have fallen away from grace!” (Galatians 5:4)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cross of Christ is the focal point of the gospel, but relying on the law to obtain God’s righteousness can render it ineffective. What does this imply? It means that those who rely on the keeping of the law will not be saved. It is the only sin for which there is no forgiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dear friends,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://vacsf.org/assets/images/man-born-blind-teaser.jpg&quot; style=&quot;border: 0px none; margin: 7px 15px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 148px; padding: 0px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;
There are two types of miracles performed by Jesus in the Bible. The first are those he performed out of compassion, and the second are those he performed to prove his Mesianic identity. The healing of the blind man at the Siloam pool falls into the second category.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;part-1&quot;&gt;PART 1&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-the-feast-of-the-tabernacles&quot;&gt;1. THE FEAST OF THE TABERNACLES&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This miracle occurred during one of Israel’s most important feasts. It’s known as the Feast of Tabernacles. Israelites from all over the country must travel to Jerusalem to observe this eight-day feast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the feast, so many lamps were lit that the entire city was illuminated. One ritual that the priests had to perform was carrying water from the pool of Siloam to the temple while walking up 15 semi-circular steps. The priests sing one Psalm from 120 to 134 at each step. They completed the final step by pouring Siloam water at the altar’s base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the feast, this ritual was repeated daily. This feast is so important to the Israelites that they tried everything they could to find a place to set up their tabernacles where they could watch the priests travel up and down the path between the pool of Siloam and the temple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-born-blind&quot;&gt;2. BORN BLIND&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus chose this particular occasion to perform this miracle in order to announce the arrival of the Messiah, who is himself. But this miracle is unlike any others he has performed. Only God, according to Jewish belief, has the power to heal someone who was born blind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt;Never before has anyone heard of someone causing a man born blind to see. &lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt;If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.”&lt;/em&gt; (John 9:32-33)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A miracle of this magnitude, performed at such a special event as the Feast of Tabernacles, with the participation of the entire nation, including all of their priests, cannot be a coincidence, but rather a plan that God had planned ahead of time to announce the arrival of the Savior of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-the-blind-and-the-sighted&quot;&gt;3. THE BLIND AND THE SIGHTED&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from performing a miracle to demonstrate that he is the Messiah, Jesus also used it to teach us about the true meaning of blindness and sight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“&lt;sup&gt;39&lt;/sup&gt;Jesus said, “For judgment I have come into this world, so that those who do not see may gain their sight, and the ones who see may become blind.” &lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;Some of the Pharisees who were with him heard this and asked him, “We are not blind too, are we?” &lt;sup&gt;41&lt;/sup&gt;Jesus replied, “If you were blind, you would not be guilty of sin, but now because you claim that you can see, your guilt remains.”&lt;/em&gt; (John 9:39-41)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What gives the Jewish leaders, or those who lived under their leadership, &lt;em&gt;“sight?”&lt;/em&gt; according to the above verse. The law was the only thing they could rely on for their belief system. As a result, in their opinion, only Gentiles who lacked the law were &lt;em&gt;“blind,”&lt;/em&gt; whereas they were “sighted” because they had the law to guide them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, how can we explain Jesus’ statement, &lt;em&gt;“If you were blind, you would not be guilty of sin?”&lt;/em&gt; Because Jesus was speaking to Jews who were subject to the law, he had to speak in their language. However, what he said went against their preconceived notions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did Jesus say that if they were blind, which meant they didn’t know the law, they would be sinless? According to Romans 4:15,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“For the law brings wrath, because where there is no law there is no transgression either.”&lt;/em&gt; (Romans 4:15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then he went on to say that because they said they could &lt;em&gt;“see,”&lt;/em&gt; which means they had the law, their sins persisted. This is contrary to popular belief throughout the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, many Christians are concerned: does this mean that anyone can choose to live apart from the law? In fact, all of humanity must follow the law. The Jews had the Ten Commandments and Moses’ law, whereas unbelievers have the law in their conscience because they gained the ability to distinguish between good and evil in the Garden of Eden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;4-the-blind-can-see&quot;&gt;4. THE BLIND CAN SEE&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Romans 4:15, &lt;em&gt;“… where there is no law, there is also no transgression,”&lt;/em&gt; which means there is no condemnation. To avoid the situation in which &lt;em&gt;“your guilt remains,”&lt;/em&gt; one must not live under the law in order for his blindness to be removed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But you can’t just walk away from the law whenever you want. Since the time man ate the forbidden fruit, the law has manifested as the knowledge of good and evil entering their conscience, and thus the world. So, who can elude the law’s grasp in order for their eyes to be opened and their sins to be forgiven?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to the Lord for opening a new path for us by replacing the old law with a new one that has the power to deliver us from sin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“For the law of the life-giving Spirit in Christ Jesus has set you free from the law of sin and death.”&lt;/em&gt; (Rô-ma 8:2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;5-who-am-i&quot;&gt;5. WHO AM I?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the fact that you came to Christ by grace through faith to receive your salvation, under which law are you currently living? The law of sin and death? The law that entered Adam and Eve’s hearts, then came down from Mount Sinai and was expanded under Moses? Or the new law of the Spirit of Life based solely on faith in Christ? If you still follow the old law, I’m afraid you’re a blind man who thinks he can see, and “your guilt remains” (John 9:41).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;part-2&quot;&gt;PART 2&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last Sunday, we spent the entire hour going over the final section of John 9 about Jesus’ healing of the man born blind. The first section of this passage demonstrates Jesus’ Messianic identity. It is not necessary for us who already believe to be convinced of this, but the latter part of the passage where Jesus explains the meaning of blindness and sight is very important so that we can live as Christians according to God’s will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This writing simply attempts to expand on what was said in the previous writing about why the Pharisees, and Jews in general, are those who are truly blind according to Jesus’ definition. Perhaps quoting other passages that say the same thing is the best way to describe the relationship between blindness and obedience to the law. Let us return to the beginning of Genesis:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“For God knows that when you eat from it your eyes will open and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.”&lt;/em&gt; (Genesis 3:5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the above verse, Adam and Eve had no knowledge of good and evil before they ate the forbidden fruit, but they had eternal life. Where else could this knowledge have come from if not from the law that had entered their minds?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“So I found that the very commandment that was intended to bring life brought death!”&lt;/em&gt; (Romans 7:10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The law, which brought death to Adam and Eve, is the enabling factor behind the knowledge of good and evil. We know that almost all religions in the world are founded on some form of law, including the law that inhabits their conscience. We who come to God by grace and faith should be more vigilant in recognizing the negative consequences of attempting to please God through legal obedience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to Genesis 3:5, they were &lt;em&gt;“blind”&lt;/em&gt; before eating the forbidden fruit, but they lived, but when &lt;em&gt;“their eyes opened,”&lt;/em&gt; they died. This is what Jesus said at the end of the passage on the healing of the man born blind in John 9:41.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Jesus replied, ‘If you were blind, you would not be guilty of sin, but now because you claim that you can see, your guilt remains.’”&lt;/em&gt; (John 9:41)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What exactly did they &lt;em&gt;“see”&lt;/em&gt;? When their eyes opened, they saw the law searching their every thought. In the New Covenant, God gave man only one way to reconcile with Him, relying on his grace and mercy rather than the power of their flesh to meet the requirements of the law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those who believe they have sight through the law are actually blind to God’s grace, whereas those who are blind to the law, meaning they no longer rely on obedience to the law to achieve God’s righteousness, have sight to God’s grace and faith in him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Jesus and nearly all of Paul’s epistles, I believe this is the true meaning of blindness and sight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last Sunday, our Sunday School class began studying the book of Colossians. Since I’ve been writing a class summary to share with class members on a regular basis, I figured why not make it available on this website as well? This Colossians study is ongoing, so one article will be added a few days after each Sunday School class. I hope you find them useful in your Christian walk.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;What is God resting from? Many think that he rests from the 6-day labor of creation. Nothing is further from the truth as God cannot be tired. He does everything with a purpose. All things He did before Christ were shadows of things to come after him. Though he started with the rest from the work of creating man, he ended with the rest from the work of saving them. This rest began after Jesus uttered his last words on the cross: “It is finished.” It is this second rest that he wants you to enter with him, but you must first understand the meaning of this rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;from-what-did-god-rest&quot;&gt;From what did God rest?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://vacsf.org/assets/images/God-rest-teaser.jpg&quot; style=&quot;border: 1px solid #cccccc; margin: 7px 15px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 148px; padding: 0px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Jewish Sabbath, which Christianity adopts though may be on a different day, symbolizes God’s rest after creation. However, the rest Jesus alludes to is about a different kind of rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For thousands of years, since man fell short of the glory they had when they were still in the garden of Eden, God gave them a means to reconnect with the divine. But the sacrifices they perpetually brought to the temples could only go so far in giving them a glimpse of the glory that was lost. The Lord never meant to give such means to them as the ultimate solution to their loss of eternal life. They were only meant as a foreshadow of the true means of reconciliation between God and man: Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus entered this rest when he gently whispered as he took his last breath on the cross: &lt;em&gt;“It’s finished.”&lt;/em&gt; But it was several years before when Jesus looked forward to this moment when he said: &lt;em&gt;“Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest (Matthew 11:28)”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also to this point at the cross when the Hebrews writer admonished his readers: &lt;em&gt;“Make every effort to enter into my rest (Hebrews 4:11)”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was no rest for the Levitical priesthood, as there were no chairs in the Holy of Holies. Sacrifices had to be continually offered for the sins of the people. But these rituals were ended at the cross when Jesus, being the Great High Priest of the line of Melchizedek offered himself, the Lamb of God, once for all for all the sins of mankind. Then he sat down at the right hand of the Father. The work of saving man was finished. He’s made them perfect once for all. Hence he rested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Day after day every priest stands and performs his religious duties; again and again he offers the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins. But when this priest had offered for all time one sacrifice for sins, he sat down at the right hand of God. Since that time he waits for his enemies to be made his footstool, because by one sacrifice he has made &lt;u&gt;perfect forever&lt;/u&gt; those who are being made holy” ( Hebrews 10:11-14 )&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What more sacrifices, penances, or acts of contrition, are needed if Jesus had made you &lt;em&gt;“perfect forever”&lt;/em&gt;? What sins need to be forgiven if Jesus’ blood had already covered them? If one has been cleansed from a guilty conscience, why the need to drag out what God had forgotten? This truth is asserted in the following Hebrews verses:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;Their sins and lawless acts I will remember no more.” &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;And where these have been forgiven, there is &lt;u&gt;no longer any sacrifice for sin&lt;/u&gt;. &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;Therefore, brothers, since we have confidence to enter the Most Holy Place by the blood of Jesus, &lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;by a new and living way opened for us through the curtain, that is, his body, &lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;and since we have a great priest over the house of God, &lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;let us draw near to God with a sincere heart in &lt;u&gt;full assurance of faith&lt;/u&gt;, having our hearts sprinkled to cleanse us from a guilty conscience and having our bodies washed with pure water. (Hebrews 10:17-22)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-are-you-doing&quot;&gt;What are you doing?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, the purveyors of the business of sins thrive in the guilty conscience of “unbelieving” believers. They, the believers, should put on &lt;em&gt;“full assurance of faith”&lt;/em&gt; to come boldly to the throne of grace, believing that God no longer counts their sins against them. But the grip on their insecurity is strong. Every time a point is being made about God’s grace, or His unconditional love, or the total forgiveness of their sins, they raise their objections: “Such unrestricted forgiveness of sins will give people a license to sin.” They mistakenly believe that the law will keep the believers in the straight and narrow, that the guilt of sin will reduce the sinful proclivity in their hearts. The truth is the law actually arouses sinful passions (Romans 7:5). Its effect is contrary to the hope of those who rely on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the believers continue to deal with sins the way they had always done. They offer sacrifices in various forms. The Jews offered their animal sacrifices, people of the world’s religions offer things that prove their repentance, and the Christians offer their lip service of asking for forgiveness. They have all forgotten, or have read but still been uninformed that God no longer accepts any further sacrifices for sins; sacrifices in whatever forms; be they confessions to a priest, or directly to God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;enter-gods-rest&quot;&gt;Enter God’s rest&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus is calling out to all those who are still under the weight of the law: &lt;em&gt;“Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest”&lt;/em&gt;, while the Hebrews writer points back to that pivotal point at Calvary: &lt;em&gt;“Make every effort to enter into my rest.”&lt;/em&gt; However, I have a strong suspicion that preciously few heed these declarations. Jesus knew this already when he said: &lt;em&gt;“Small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life, and only a few find it.”&lt;/em&gt;  Few, like the only two Israelites, Joshua and Caleb, that had enough faith to come into the promised land while more than 600 thousands would rather perish than enter God’s land of rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We would do well to learn from the Galatians by avoiding their insistence in relying on their own effort to bring to completion what Christ had finished:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth, crucified among you? &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;This only would I learn of you, Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith? &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh? (Galatians 3:1-3)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-tell&quot;&gt;How to tell&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you still trying to relate to God through sins, through the permissible or forbidden things you do, or not do? As these things determine your relationship with God, whether they bring you closer to God or drive you apart from him? If you do, the Bible says you’re living in sin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the Bible says that you’re no longer in sin because Christ had been raised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;if Christ has not been raised, your faith is useless; you are still in your sins (1 Corinthians 15:17).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sole reason God considers you as not in your sins is because Christ had been raised. It’s not because you’re living a perfect life. It’s not because you can no longer sin like a common man. The fact is the capacity for sins is ever present in everyone’s flesh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, stop trying to rid sins from your life, but instead rest in the finished work of Christ on the cross. That is the only way to live a victorious life, and the only way to live a life that pleases the Lord. And don’t be foolish like the Galatians who continually try to improve on Christ’s work to present you perfect and blameless in God’s sight. It’s done. It’s finished. REST.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Luke started out prefacing this parable with an assumption that Jesus told it in order to encourage us to pray always. My understanding is Jesus was teaching us an entirely different thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-parable&quot;&gt;The parable&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://vacsf.org/assets/images/persistent-widow-teaser.jpg&quot; style=&quot;border: 1px solid #cccccc; margin: 7px 15px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 148px; padding: 0px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Then Jesus told them a parable to show them they should always pray and not lose heart.  &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; He said, “In a certain city there was a judge who neither feared God nor respected people.  &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;There was also a widow in that city who kept coming to him and saying, ‘Give me justice against my adversary.’  &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;For a while he refused, but later on he said to himself, ‘Though I neither fear God nor have regard for people,  &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;yet because this widow keeps on bothering me, I will give her justice, or in the end she will wear me out by her unending pleas.’”  &lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;And the Lord said, “Listen to what the unrighteous judge says!  &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;Won’t God give justice to his chosen ones, who cry out to him day and night? Will he delay long to help them?  &lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;I tell you, he will give them justice speedily. Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on earth? (Luke 18:1-8)”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-faith-of-the-widow&quot;&gt;The faith of the widow&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The object of the woman’s faith is a judge, who is deemed an unjust judge in other translations of the Bible. She may have heard of his reputation as a kind of man who &lt;em&gt;“neither feared God nor respected people.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her “faith” in this judge is like this: He’s a very unjust man. He doesn’t listen to the little people. He’s preferential toward the rich and the powerful. He takes bribes. Had I had some money to give I wouldn’t have to knock as much. He doesn’t have my well-being in mind. He can’t care less if I live or die. Unless I bother him so much with all the knocking, he wouldn’t give me a hearing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is very typical of a relationship between a powerful figure and one at a lower rank of society. It explains why most people relate to their deity the same way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;is-persistence-the-essence-of-faith&quot;&gt;Is persistence the essence of faith?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The title “Persistent widow” for this parable was just something translators came up with to capture what they thought was its core message. But Jesus never taught faith in this sense. He never teaches how much you believe, but whether or not you believe, and if you need to define a quantity, the amount as big as a mustard seed is enough. Likewise, he defines the strength of your faith according to the quality of its object, like WHO do you believe. You can have faith that move mountains, but if it’s based on a faulty object, it’s useless. You can have great faith in a chair, and be as persistent as anyone can be, but if it has been eaten through by termites, it will not support you. Conversely, if it’s built of strong wood and in great condition, no matter how feeble your faith is, it will securely support your weight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lengthy-prayer&quot;&gt;Lengthy prayer?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Matthew 6:7-13, Jesus taught us not to pray on and on like the pagans for the reason that God knows all your needs, so don’t pray as if he’s deaf or hard of hearing. For in doing so, you’re making God to be like the unjust judge in this parable. Since Jesus could not contradict himself, he must not have taught persistent, or repetitive, praying, but instead a persistence in believing, in trusting, in knowing the One you’re unloading your burden on. Yet, sermon after sermon, commentaries after commentaries, and even the Bible translators, fall into the trap of teaching this parable as an example in persistent praying. For thousands of years, since the beginning of Christianity, to spend an extended amount of time on one’s knees praying is considered among the greatest Christian virtues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lengthy praying says nothing about a person’s faith. Neither does tenacity, or loyalty. It’s a false humility to cloak a hidden desire for self exaltation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;god-in-your-own-image&quot;&gt;God in your own image&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The inclination to believe that unless you pray long and hard, you won’t move the hand of God, is almost a universal phenomenon. Most of the world’s religions also share in this belief. Some religion’s adherents inflict pain upon themselves to get their gods to hear them. Scream as loud as you can, and maybe your deity will hear you. Focus, use the right words, have the right attitude, think the right thoughts. It all depends on your prayerful performance whether or not your prayer will be answered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The principle reason for this approach toward deities is they’re mostly conjured up in the mind of the believer from their life’s experiences. The deity takes on the personality of the powerful figure in their life. His ability to respond to their request, his fairness in dealing with his subjects, his temper tantrums and what not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such is the relationship between the widow and her judge in the parable. He’s hard of hearing, so she has to knock long and hard. Furthermore, he’s known to be unjust, so though he responded to her tenacious knocking, his answers may not spring from his knowledge of her situation, or how his decision may affect her life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, when Jesus parabolically concluded the story with &lt;em&gt;“When the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on earth?”&lt;/em&gt;, he was hinting at something completely different than Luke’s introduction to the parable. He was asking his listeners whether they would know God as he should be known, because he knew the widow, who is perhaps no different than the disciples that surrounded him, though may have faith, her faith, and theirs, was a faith in a god created in their own image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-differences&quot;&gt;The differences&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to contrast the judge against God. The judge was in a deep slumber. God never sleeps. The judge was uninterested in the woman’s situation. God knew her even before she was knitted in her mother’s womb. The judge may not be able to solve the woman’s problem as the opposing party in her situation may be more powerful than him. Our God is omnipotent. The judge lacks compassion toward the woman. God so loved the world that he sent his only begotten Son. The judge granted her request just to shut her up without regard to whether his answer helps or hurt her in the long run. God may or may not grant a request, he does it based on his foreknowledge of the plan for each person’s life. Lastly, this judge is hard of hearing, but our God knows the inward groaning of all his people even before they could voice them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-kind-of-faith&quot;&gt;What kind of faith?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Jesus asked at the end of the parable: &lt;em&gt;“When the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on earth?”&lt;/em&gt;, he meant anything but persistent prayer. Let’s look at how John defines eternal life:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Now this is eternal life: that they know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent. (John 17:3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eternal life has nothing to do with what you do for God, for he can send the angels of heaven to accomplish whatever in his plan, but it has everything to do with knowing God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will you know that God is not like that judge? Will you know that  he desires a relationship with you unlike that of the widow and the judge? Will you know that God is infinitely more knowing and compassionate than the judge? But Jesus knew better. He knew a multitude went to church, wore the badge of Christianity, but few truly knew him. Most relate to him like a transaction, if I do this, will you do that for me? Since I have done this, can I expect you to do that? But so rare were those who were humble enough to acknowledge that God could do whatever he wished, and he owed them nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great faith may prompt one who is in need to raise their concern to God, then leave it at that, knowing that they do not have to pray long and hard, they don’t have to try to move his hands with long extended prayers, but leave their burden at the throne of grace knowing that all things will work out for them in due time. But such faith is rare, as most believe that God reciprocates the amount of time they spend on their knees. Their god is deaf, our God can hear the saint’s prayer even before it is spoken, their god cannot hear the cry of the little people, our God cares for even a little sparrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It won’t just be whether, when the Son of Man returns, he will find faith, but whether he will find faith &lt;em&gt;“on earth.”&lt;/em&gt; Mostlikely, He will find many who have the kind of faith like that of the widow toward the unjust judge, and just as many who read this parable and draw the conclusion that it’s about persistence in prayer. Will he find true faith on earth? Will he find any who knows him as he is?&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Have you heard a sermon based on the Bible quote &lt;em&gt;“many live as enemies of the cross of Christ”&lt;/em&gt;? What comes immediately to your mind as you contemplate its meaning? I’m almost certain most Christians got it wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;am-i-guilty&quot;&gt;Am I guilty?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://vacsf.org/assets/images/enemies-of-the-cross-teaser.jpg&quot; style=&quot;border: 1px solid #cccccc; margin: 7px 15px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 148px; padding: 0px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;
It didn’t take long after becoming a Christian that I heard the verse in question for the first time. Without needing my pastor to elaborate on its meaning, I immediately formed in my mind what actions, or attitudes, would make me an enemy of the cross. Decades later, the notion of what those things were was still vague. Yet, they dictated my every waking moment, caused me to walk with God as if on eggshells. A silent alarm constantly went off, but I learned to suppress it, to press the proverbial snooze button. Yet, it only delayed the onset of the next alarm, perhaps causing even more anxiety. Oftentimes, the implied meaning of the verse spoke louder than the explicit, to gather more under the umbrella of suspicions while leaving me longing for the peace that Jesus promised. Far be it from me to be an enemy of the cross, but being fully acceptable to the Lord, I wasn’t sure. It is the limbo between God’s full acceptance and being his enemy that kept me in a constant state of uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;philippians-318&quot;&gt;Philippians 3:18&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ (KJV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;transgressions-make-you-the-enemy&quot;&gt;Transgressions make you the enemy?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it some bad things that you do, or the failure to do some good things, that make you God’s enemy?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The view of the law held by most people is that it is only broken when it can be externally observed, spelled out in some written rules, and had witnesses. Such as the laws against murder, adultery, stealing, and others. But any serious student of the Scriptures should know that the law goes much deeper than that. It’s exposes the heart of man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You have heard that it was said, ‘Do not commit adultery.’ But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman to lust after her has already committed adultery with her in his heart. (Matthew 5:27-28)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, in effect, everyone is an enemy of the cross, if indeed transgression is the key factor. Then Paul should have written Philippians 3:18 to address everyone, including himself that they’re all guilty just the same. But what would the point be if he did so? In the vain hope that some among them can stop sinning so they can stop becoming enemies of the cross?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-covenants&quot;&gt;The Covenants&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two Covenants, the Old and the New, determine the outcomes of man’s relationship with God. Under the Old Covenant, a man is required to keep all of the law to remain in God. After allowing man a long enough period of time to show them their inability to keep all the requirements of the law, God gave them a chance to reconcile with him through the death of Jesus on the cross. It’s a free gift to be freely received as it is so priceless that no one can afford to pay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The door through the New Covenant is opened, and the door that no one could budge, the Old Covenant, has been taken away forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what if some insist on entering God’s kingdom through the old door? They insist that they have some part in the salvation of their depraved humanity? They’re driven by the same pride that drove Adam and Eve to try to become like God, to acquire the knowledge of good and evil. What did that make of them, in their relationship with their Maker?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;confidence-in-the-flesh&quot;&gt;Confidence in the flesh&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s put some context to Philippians 3:18. Here are verses 2 and 3 which precede verse 18:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Watch out for those dogs, those evildoers, those mutilators of the flesh. &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;For it is we who are the circumcision, we who serve God by his Spirit, who boast in Christ Jesus, and who put no &lt;u&gt;confidence in the flesh&lt;/u&gt;. (Philippians 3:2-3 — NIV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note the severity of the language in verse 2. Paul called some people dogs, and evildoers. What did they do that warranted such harsh descriptions? They are &lt;em&gt;“mutilators of the flesh,”&lt;/em&gt; and they put their &lt;em&gt;“confidence in the flesh.”&lt;/em&gt; This type of contrasts is found in Galatians, Romans, Hebrews, and here in Philippians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul must be comparing the circumcision through law keeping against the true circumcision of the heart by the Spirit. All the books listed in the paragraph above should establish a proper foundation for understanding what Paul is writing about here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People who give in to fleshly temptation, do so out of the weakness of their flesh. However, there is clearly a purpose when one puts confidence in the flesh. It’s not a weakness, but purposeful action to use means of the flesh to earn God’s favor.  The one is easily identified through the commandments, or laws, the other is more subtle, but carefully, and exhaustively, laid out in many of Paul’s epistles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which of these makes one the enemy of the cross? It’s obviously the latter. It’s a belief system. It’s an attempt to attain God’s righteousness through human efforts. But strangely, and frustratingly, messages from pulpits are anything but that. Their messages are that your sins are what that makes you the enemies of the cross. Few, if any, ever makes the connection with legalism as the true enemy of the cross. Sins can be forgiven, but legalism is the ultimate denial of the cross. It’s no wonder that so few Christians really understand the gospel, let alone sharing it with the unbelieving world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-true-enemy-of-the-cross&quot;&gt;The true enemy of the cross&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two verses below should add more strength to the argument that the true enemy of the cross is not someone who is outside of the Christian faith, is not a Christian who still at times gives in to the weakness of their flesh, but is someone who though may have begun in God’s grace, but now pursue, or advocate for, an alternative to the cross of Christ, or a different gospel as it is referred to in Galatians 1:6. In short, it’s their returning to obedience to the law to attain the righteousness of God. It’s the antithesis of sole reliance on the finished work of Christ on the cross. The &lt;em&gt;“falling away”&lt;/em&gt; in Hebrews 6:6 below speaks of the Hebrews’ return to the obsoleted, hence ineffective, offering of animal sacrifices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;You who are trying to be declared righteous by the law have been alienated from Christ; you have fallen away from grace! (Galatians 5:4)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;For it is impossible in the case of those who have once been enlightened, tasted the heavenly gift, become partakers of the Holy Spirit,  &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;tasted the good word of God and the miracles of the coming age,  &lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;and then have committed apostasy, to renew them again to repentance, since they are crucifying the Son of God for themselves all over again and holding him up to contempt. (Hebrews 6:4-6)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;gospel-shaped-world-view&quot;&gt;Gospel-shaped world view&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How you understand the gospel profoundly affects your world view, and ultimately your relationship with God. A proper understanding will keep you from becoming legalistic and judgmental. It lays a proper foundation for you to know God’s peace.  It prevents you from entering the treadmill of performance, or helps you get off of it. It gives you the wisdom to see the futility of trying to please God as He cannot be pleased except by His only begotten Son; it’s not that He doesn’t appreciate you trying to please Him, it’s that you don’t have what it takes to do the impossible. Last but not least, it gives you the assurance that you’re not God’s enemy, and leave to Him the judgement whether someone else is the enemy of the cross, as He alone knows the heart of man.&lt;/p&gt;
