    &lt;p&gt;Many are concerned that the unlimitted teaching of grace will cause many to fall into antinomianism, and take advantage of the grace of God and find a license to sin. However Dr. Chalmers, an 18th century theologian, attempts to show us in his writing that such is not a case in the Christian experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dr-chalmers-on-the-gospel&quot;&gt;Dr. Chalmers on the gospel&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Thus it is, that &lt;strong&gt;the freer the Gospel, the more sanctifying&lt;/strong&gt; is the Gospel; and the more it is received as a doctrine of grace, the more will it be felt as a doctrine according to godliness.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This is one of the secrets of the Christian life, that &lt;strong&gt;the more a man holds of God, the greater is the payment of service&lt;/strong&gt; that he renders back again.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;On the tenure of “&lt;strong&gt;Do this and live&lt;/strong&gt;,” a spirit of fearfulness is sure to enter; and the jealousies of a legal bargain chase away all confidence from the intercourse between God and man; and the creature striving to be square and even with his Creator, is, in fact, pursuing all the while his own selfishness, instead of God’s glory; and with all the conformities which he labours to accomplish, the soul of obedience is not there, the mind is not subject to the law of God, nor indeed under such an economy ever can be.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;It is only when, as in the Gospel, acceptance is bestowed as a present, without money, and without price, that the security which man feels in God is placed beyond the reach of disturbance - or, that he can repose in Him, as one friend reposes in another - or, that any liberal and generous understanding can be established betwixt them - the one party rejoicing over the other to do him good - the other finding that the truest gladness of his heart lies in the impulse of a gratitude, by which it is awakened to the charms of a new moral existence.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Salvation by grace - salvation by free grace - salvation not of works, but according to the mercy of God - salvation on such a footing is not more indispensable to the deliverance of our persons from the hand of God’s justice, than it is to the deliverance of our hearts from the chill and the weight of ungodliness.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Retain a single shred or fragment of legality with the Gospel, and we raise a topic of distrust between man and God.  We take away from the power of the Gospel to melt and to conciliate.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;For this purpose, the freer it is, the better it is. That very peculiarity which so many dread as the germ of antinomianism, is, in fact, the germ of a new spirit, and a new inclination against it.  Along with the light of a free Gospel, there enters the love of the Gospel, which, in proportion as we impair the freeness, we are sure to chase away.  And never does the sinner find within himself so mighty a moral transformation, as when he is under the belief that he is saved by grace, for he feels constrained thereby to offer his heart a devoted thing, and to deny ungodliness.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;some-key-thoughts-as-gleaned-from-the-excerpt&quot;&gt;Some key thoughts as gleaned from the excerpt&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-gospel-the-freer-the-more-sanctifying&quot;&gt;The Gospel, the freer the more sanctifying&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrary to conventional thinking which believes that the preaching of a free gospel will lead to folks finding licence to sin or excuse to abuse God’s grace, Dr Chalmers as well as I believe that a freer gospel will lead to more godliness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;do-this-and-live&quot;&gt;Do this and live&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Old Covenant can be summarized to the concept of “Do this and live,” carefully observing all the commandments written in the book of the law, &lt;em&gt;“Keep[ing] this Book of the Law always on your lips; meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do everything written in it. Then you will be prosperous and successful (Joshua 1:8).”&lt;/em&gt; Ironically the Bible calls this the law of sin and death, and in the same Romans 8:2 passage Paul suggest a new law of the Spirit of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the old law, there is fear, and there is jealousy as one is never certain of God’s acceptance, and in trying to repay God for what He’s done, the person become excessively obsessed toward self instead of God’s glory, and lastly though there is an appearance of obedience, it’s not from the heart, but from fear of punishment. Such is the nature of a “legal bargain” where everything must be earned and paid for. There is always the possibility that your performance is not good enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-more-a-man-holds-of-god-the-greater-the-payment-of-service&quot;&gt;The more a man holds of God, the greater the payment of service&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would probably not go as far as calling the work, that God has prepared beforehand for those who have come to Him by grace and through faith, a payment of service, but even if such a term is used, that God does indeed demand a payment, a man cannot pay more than what he received from God. &lt;em&gt;“The more a man holds of God”&lt;/em&gt;, as Dr Chalmers puts it, means the more he understands the height, depth, and breadth of God’s forgiveness through Christ, the full righteousness that he can be certain of as he puts his trust in Him, the freedom from all condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus, and the all things that God has given him along with His Son, the more he can be an instrument in the hand of God to do the work that is not based on the law, but on faith and purified by grace. In short, the more a man knows his &lt;a href=&quot;http://vacsf.org/articles/The-Will-of-God/&quot;&gt;inheritance in Christ&lt;/a&gt;, the more he can pay, not from the works of his flesh, but from the riches that God had already reserved for him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;acceptance-bestowed-as-a-present&quot;&gt;Acceptance bestowed as a present&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without money, and without price. Only then can there be security and true rest just like a friend is relaxed in the presence of another, and if there is anything the one does for the other, it is from a heart filled with gratitude. This is a new moral existence that is to be desired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;heart-that-knows-its-full-acceptance&quot;&gt;Heart that knows its full acceptance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As important as the truth of salvation by grace, it is of no less importance the deliverance of the heart from the fear and burden of our not being fully accepted by God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;if-there-is-but-a-single-shred-of-legality-with-the-gospel&quot;&gt;If there is but a single shred of legality with the gospel&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The power of the gospel lies in its ability to forgive man and to reconcile them with God, therefore if any amount of legality is implied in the gospel as it is presented, it will take away that power and causes serious distrust between a man and his God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-freer-the-better-is-the-gospel&quot;&gt;The freer the better is the gospel&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Chalmers says it best: “And never does the sinner find within himself so mighty a moral transformation, as when he is under the belief that he is saved by grace, for he feels constrained thereby to offer his heart a devoted thing, and to deny ungodliness.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;One mistranslated word can completely change the meaning of a verse. The mistranslation though may have been unintentional, it could reflect the theology of the translator; the implication can be profound, as it affects how people view their relationship with God, and consequently leads them astray.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/nav&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://vacsf.org/viet-studies/E-phe-so-2-1/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Bấm vào đây để đọc tiếng Việt)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-has-someone-become-a-sinner&quot;&gt;How has someone become a sinner?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://vacsf.org/assets/images/ephesians21-teaser.jpg&quot; style=&quot;border: 1px solid #cccccc; margin: 7px 15px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 148px; padding: 0px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;
There is almost always a great discrepancy between what a Christian believes theologically and what they believe in their heart which is reflected in the outworking of such belief. Their perception of the origin of their sin is what this article will address. This perception will in turn influence their understanding of the forgiveness of God which decidedly will characterize their relationship with God. The issue of sin and death is profoundly intertwined with forgiveness and life; if sin is misunderstood, so will it be with forgiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a previous article, &lt;a href=&quot;http://vacsf.org/articles/When-The-Son-Sets-You-Free/&quot;&gt;“When The Son Sets You Free”&lt;/a&gt;, I cited an example of a man who was practically dead in every way from the effect of drug addiction. He contributed nothing toward his eventual deliverance; all his effort to quit ended up in the desire for more, to the point he was so wasted that he was waiting for death to overtake him; if there was an inkling in his mind of a deity somewhere that he could pray to, he would, but he was too far gone to bother; he must have felt completely forsaken. So I quoted Ephesians 2:1 to illustrate God’s salvation to even one at such a dead state as him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As for you, you were dead in your transgressions and sins. (Ephesians 2:1)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far so good. This verse in the NIV translation, or in other translations such as KJV or NET that I often use, is fitting in describing the sad state that our drug addict was in before he was saved by the Lord. It can be universally applied to all men as &lt;em&gt;“all have sinned and fallen short of God’s glory (Romans 3:23).”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as I was confidently translating the aforementioned article into Vietnamese, I was in a bit of a shock to find the Vietnamese translation of Ephesians 2:1 saying something completely different from practically all the English versions. It says &lt;em&gt;“As for you, you were dead BECAUSE OF your transgressions and sins.”&lt;/em&gt;  I was quite taken aback upon reading such rendition of the verse. Would this mean if someone manages not to commit any transgressions or sins, they would not have been spiritually dead? That there is a possibility that there might be such a person who can defy the principle that all have sinned and fallen short of God’s glory?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually I must confess that there is a bit of malice in my thought as I discovered another such gross error in this translation; it proves my point that it is incumbent upon the reader of even such revered text as Scriptures to be vigilant in checking everything that is read against as many known and clear foundational truths as possible to avoid errors in interpretation or translation. The English versions simply help confirm the error in the Vietnamese translation, but even without them, the error is easily spotted if the reader is well equipped with a comprehensive set of basic truths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;contradicting-other-passages&quot;&gt;Contradicting other passages&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Vietnamese translation gives the impression that if someone can resolve to not commit the sins and trespasses, they can be spiritually alive, but both Romans 3:23 quoted above, and 1 John 1:8,10 says otherwise, that it is impossible for anyone to be without sins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If we claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us. … If we claim we have not sinned, we make him out to be a liar and his word is not in us. (1 John 1:8,10)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But let us revisit the problematic Vietnamese translation of the verse so we won’t lose track of why we get here: &lt;em&gt;“As for you, you were dead BECAUSE OF your transgressions and sins.”&lt;/em&gt;  We know from the very basic understanding of the gospel that we are dead not because of the things that we do—the bad things that we do or the good things that we fail to do—, but because of who we are: sinners in need of God’s grace and mercies. We’re sinners even if we haven’t committed any sins common to man, as it is written in Romans 5:12-14:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, and in this way death came to all men, because all sinned – for before the law was given, sin was in the world. But sin is not taken into account when there is no law. Nevertheless, death reigned from the time of Adam to the time of Moses, even over those who did not sin by breaking a command, as did Adam, who was a pattern of the one to come.” (Romans 5:12-14)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;being-dead-versus-being-alive&quot;&gt;Being dead versus being alive&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the Vietnamese translation of Ephesians 2:1 holds true, people are only spiritually dead when they commit certain sins or trespasses, so when they don’t sin, assuming it’s possible, or that they have adequately paid for their sins—through means such as confession which I don’t believe they can—, they’re spiritually alive. This assumption also runs against the truth put forth in Scriptures about what makes sinners come alive: the indwelling Spirit  who is given to believers upon their faith in Christ. Let’s keep in mind that it’s their faith in Christ that counts, not their ability to resist sins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the mindset of the Vietnamese version of Ephesians 2:1, believers are like a yo-yo in their being dead and alternately being alive, as often as in their sinning and not sinning. This pattern of life may be reasonable under the Old Covenant, but it’s no longer so under the New Covenant. Under the old, the offering for the remission of sin was repeated over and over again because sin was never completely erased, but under the new, Christ was offered once for all and never to be repeated again. So for those who were dead and brought back to life through the faith in Christ, and if they, &lt;em&gt;“BECAUSE OF”&lt;/em&gt; their sins and trespasses, become dead again, and since Christ cannot be crucified again, how are they to become alive again? Through confessions of their sins? No, this cannot be, since &lt;em&gt;“without the shedding of blood, there is no remission of sins.”&lt;/em&gt; (Hebrews 9:22).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reverting-back-to-the-old-way&quot;&gt;Reverting back to the old way&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mistranslation of Ephesians 2:1 is not simply an error in translation, it’s emblematic of man’s tendency to rely on the flesh no matter what Bible versions, hence their reliance on the keeping of the law to walk with God. This is also reflected in the misinterpretation of many passages of Scriptures though they may have been correctly translated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Christ died once for all for sin, a believer also becomes alive in the Spirit once for all as they entered the trust relationship with God in Christ.  The faulty belief causes them to doubt the assurance of salvation, as they think their sins and trespasses cause them to die again, and so they’re thrown back into the loop of trying to find remedy for their sins, with “sin confession” as one among many means to ease their guilty conscience. And so they’re sent back to the desert for a complete and symbolic forty years of desert of frustration and toil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;correct-translation-of-ephesians-21&quot;&gt;Correct translation of Ephesians 2:1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As for you, you were dead in your transgressions and sins. (Ephesians 2:1)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The English translation is already correct. You were dead, just as Adam and Eve of old were dead, just like the rest of mankind who were born in corruptible flesh. All your transgressions and sins were but inevitable fruit of your flesh in which you are struggling until the day the Lord gives you an incorruptible flesh (1 Corinthians 15).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Matthew 5:48 says this about God: &lt;em&gt;‘Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.’&lt;/em&gt; Therefore, if Christ hasn’t already made you perfect, when will you be? One more revival meeting? One more communion? One more Bible verse to memorize? One more soul to win for Christ? No, if you aren’t already perfectly acceptable to God, you will never be.&lt;/p&gt;

What does a human heart need? What drives a person to seek relief in work, alcohol, drug, gambling, or various other forms of addiction? The mathematician and philosopher Blaise Pascal shared his understanding that there is a God-shaped vacuum in the human heart, which is really not far from the truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Bible contains roughly 500 instances of an attribute of God that is described as love, grace, mercies, compassion, or other forms of it, and 1 John 4:8 declares that God is Love. Then it stands to reason that what the aforementioned relief seekers really need is love, which is the nature of God, but they found only a temporary relief that not only didn’t last, but may even wreck their lives and the lives of those that love them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God is doing amazing things in Vietnam in healing and restoring young people whose lives had been wrecked by drug addiction. These addicts, tried as they may, they could not wrest themselves from the powerful grip of an ill that destroys both mind and body, but it was there that God’s saving grace shone ever more brightly. Once they found hope at a Christian recovery center in Vietnam, the Word of God, as they started to learn and memorize it, began to heal their minds and subsequently their bodies in such a way we could not describe as anything but miracles. All these recovered addicts virtually spoke in unison that it was God’s love, and their knowledge of it, that saved them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article will cite a testimony, one out of dozens of recorded testimonies, and perhaps hundreds of other unspoken ones, of a man who was delivered from drug addiction as a demonstration of salvation by God’s grace, then suggest that it must be by that same grace that the recovered addict must walk until their journey on earth is done. The temptation to go back to the law, hence the reliance on the strength of the flesh, is strong, and once the saved-by-grace Christian unknowingly falls back to walking by the flesh, they will find their yoke to be anything but easy  and their burden anything but light. Sadly this is the story of many Christians, and this article hopes to point them to a better way to enjoy the life that is supposed to be as abundant as Jesus had promised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;Portrait of a drug addict&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I’m the second child in a family of five siblings. I was born in 19__ in Hanoi, Vietnam, into a family of crime. My childhood was filled with pain and sorrow. Being a son of a criminal, I was rejected by my peers. These negative experiences filled the heart of an innocent child with so much pain and sorrow beyond his years. I was ashamed of my father, and hatred began to fill my heart. Then I found the next logical thing to do was to quit school and join the gang, following my father’s footsteps. The saying “the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree” was fulfilled when my brothers, similarly one after another followed the crime filled path of the family.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2&gt;Life in the gang&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I dove into the street life, getting addicted to cocaine and heroin, becoming a thief, a robber, a debt collector, a killer for hire, a drug pusher, and a pimp. I would persuade girls who just left the countryside for the big city to become prostitutes. Those who never had any experience with drugs, I let them try so they became addicts and subjected under my control. I had to pay for such sinful lifestyle with years in prison. But prison could not change me. I became even more violent and committed even more crimes upon leaving prison. Each action that followed was worse than the last. Then came the last time, in 2010, when I was released to return to my family after six years in prison. But upon returning home I lost all hope to live and survive. My whole family was broken. Some of my brothers were addicted to drugs, some were in prison. My mother was always drinking, gambling, and had no care nor love for anyone else. My wife left and re-married. I heard from someone that before she married another husband, she gave my only son away to some temple.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2&gt;Hoping to die&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;When I was in so much pain and lost all hope to live, I thought of my family, of my son, of the years in prison, and the years being addicted to drugs. I no longer wanted to live like that anymore, but I was at a dead end without an escape. In utter despair, I decided to seek an end to my life. I thought death would be the solution  to all my problems. A drug overdose seemed to be a possible solution. I then hired a motorbike taxi driver, giving him 500,000 dong (equivalent to $25 USD at the time) to buy me a powerful drug and a syringe for my suicide attempt.  However a strange thing happened as I did not die. Someone told me later that they found me already clinically dead with pupils was dilated, so they called for transportation to take me to the emergency room of a hospital. The doctors tried to resuscitate me without success. Then they announced that I was dead and transferred my body to the morgue. In the middle of the night, I woke up finding myself inside the hospital’s morgue. When I walked out, everyone was terrified thinking they had seen a ghost.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2&gt;Seeking death again&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, upon returning home, I still had no desire to live. I sought to find death once again. I locked myself in a private room with several hundred liters of liquor which I bought and put in a large container. For a straight two months and seventeen days, I did not see anyone, ate nothing except drinking alcohol. At the end of this period, there was only skin and bone left on my body. The muscles of my arms and legs had shrunken, and I was immobilized. I released bodily wastes in the same place where I stayed. I thought perhaps I would have only a few more days to live.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2&gt;My life raft&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Right around this time, my cousin who worked at the  Binh Long rehabilitation center headed by Pastor Si Tan Ngo, had some time off so he came to pay me a visit. Seeing me in my condition, he broke into tears and said, “Hai, there is one way you can be saved.” “Which way is that?” I asked. And he answered, “Follow Jesus. He saved me from sins and drugs.” Though at that moment I knew nothing about God, I told him, “Yes, let me go with you.” But during that time, I was nearly paralyzed and could not travel to Binh Long in the South. Then my cousin brought Mrs. Hoan who was Nam Quoc Trung’s mother, together with Minh Ngoc Nguyen to come and pray with me to accept Christ and then brought me to Bac Giang rehabilitation center.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2&gt;Christ entered my life&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I arrived in Bac Giang on December 17, 2010. I could never forget Christmas that year as it was the first time I came to the Bac Giang rescue center. It was the Christmas that  Jesus entered my life. I was unable to move about independently due to the two months and seventeen days without food except alcohol which caused me to suffer from mental collapse and physical weakness. Upon arrival at the center, I was brought into the prayer room, and I was awakened at the sight of a board with lyrics of the hymn “When a Child is Born” written on it. The words of the hymn broke my heart, and I mumbled and wept while singing, and kept repeating the verse,&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 5%;&quot;&gt;“A ray of hope flitters in the sky. A shiny star lights up way up high. All across the land dawns a brand new morn. This comes to pass when a child is born”.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Surely the lyrics of this hymn reflected my life, a life filled with darkness, without happiness, and without hope. But for loving me Jesus came. He is the bright light, the joy and the hope of my life.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2&gt;The recovery&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When I first arrived at the center, I was very weak, with a body weight of only about 84 lbs. I figured it would take at least six months before I could recover. But the fearful and wonderful thing was God had fully restored me, healing me in both body and mind in only a month and a half. A miracle indeed!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2&gt;Living with gratitude&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I am eternally grateful for all Jesus Christ had done for me. Were it not for Him to seek me out and save me, I would have been buried six feet under.  Since following Christ until now, there are still things in my life that still leave much to be desired, but thanks to His mercies, love and grace, He continues to forgive and lift me up. He pours His love upon me and uses me in loving and caring for the other addicts when they were first admitted to the center. I truly rejoice upon seeing them overcoming the effect of drug withdrawal, experiencing healing, and a new life in the name of Jesus. I share the joy with their parents, spouses, and children… the kind of joy that I had never known before. My hope and desire is God would use the remainder of my life to bring salvation to those being imprisoned and chained by addictions and sins like I was. So they may also experience new and blessed lives when Jesus enters their hearts. All glory be to God. Amen!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;saved-by-grace&quot;&gt;Saved by grace&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not difficult to convince anyone of the fact that this man was saved from a life of drug addiction by God’s grace, and likewise his deliverance from a sin nature which is infinitely more formidable than the power of drugs. But it’s not easy to prove to the overwhelming majority in Christianity that they are to live by God’s grace as well. Let’s quickly trace our drug addict’s journey to the light to set the stage for the case for living by God’s grace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How did this man escape the grip of drug addiction? Through sheer determination? Through obedience? Through repentance after each painful failure? Through gradual reduction of drug use? Prayer? No, he didn’t do any of the above, or perhaps he tried but failed. He was on a downward spiral to the point he attempted suicide twice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the second suicide attempt, we read that this man locked himself in a room for two months and seventeen days with hundreds of liters of liquor with the intention of drowning himself in it. Can you imagine the depth of his despair? The depression that was his darkest of nights? He was like a lost member in the valley of dry bones in Ezekiel 37. Though this man’s heart was still beating weakly inside his body of skin and bones, he was practically dead. Hope, if he had any, was all but lost, for if he had a fleeting thought of it, he’d have prayed, but this seemingly easy act of praying never made it out of his mouth. The end was so near, just a few more days, so he thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then out of the blue, perhaps by divine providence that a cousin who was working for a rehab center came to pay him a visit at that critical moment when he was hovering at the edge of oblivion. And as they say the rest is history, our addict was on his road to recovery. Ephesians 2:1 and Romans 5:8 were demonstrated in his life so beautifully:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As for you, you were dead in your trespasses and sins. (Ephesians 2:1)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us. (Romans 5:8)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This man was definitely dead in … drugs, yet Christ died for him two thousand years ago so that today he might live. His conversion, though more dramatic than most, obeys the same principle spelled out in such verses as Ephesians 2:8-9: &lt;em&gt;“For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—not by works, so that no one can boast.”&lt;/em&gt; Just as he was saved by faith, and not by the works of his efforts to quit drugs, so was he saved from spiritual death through that same faith, and not by the works of avoiding sins. If it was impossible for him to achieve freedom from addiction with his own strength, it would be infinitely more impossible for him to achieve freedom from his sin nature, by trying to avoid sinning at all cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though most Christian do not struggle with drugs like our man in the story, they do struggle with sins in general, with other forms of addiction like work, alcohol, gambling, jealousy, self pity, low self esteem, pornography, and myriad such vices. To them the struggles are just as severe as drug addiction. If the drug addict cannot wrest himself from his depraved condition, neither can they. What they all need is the power of God, not their own strength as no amount of it is enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, at this point, we have established that our recovered drug addict contributed nothing toward his salvation. Does it then stand to reason that he likewise will not be able to contribute anything toward his sanctification? If his flesh couldn’t cleanse the drugs from his system, how will it ever make him holy enough to meet God?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-joy-of-salvation&quot;&gt;The joy of salvation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most testimonies end right about here, and this man’s testimony is no exception. But in reality, here is where the story really begins. The initial moment of joy of salvation will quickly recede into the background to yield to a state of normalcy that will endure for perhaps decades until one’s journey on earth is done. But it is during this post-salvation phase that one’s root grows deep into the faith that began at the moment of repentance. There is no exception. The initial joy of salvation must transition into something more abiding, something that does not depend on transitory feelings, be they tears of joy or songs of praise or blessings received, but on something that is immovable, that will endure forever; something that is based on the character of God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, many new Christians fall into the trap of trying to hang on to this initial moment as a standard that they must measure all subsequent experiences against. The normalcy of daily humdrum become suspect that one might have fallen from grace. So the recovered addict, or the babe in Christ who had a first taste of God’s grace and mercies, frantically engages himself in activities that might propel him back to that state that may not necessarily be experienced again. They mistakenly believe that the initial joy of salvation is a measure of how God loves and accept them, hence they deduce that a decline from such emotional high is a sign that God is no longer pleased with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-different-addiction&quot;&gt;A different addiction?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is our new Christian to do? The experience he just had became a golden standard against which he must now evaluate everything. But the joy he felt, the new found freedom he just experienced, the clarity of mind that came as a result of a euphoric encounter with the divine, and many other wonderful benefits since he came to Christ, are becoming increasing elusive. In a frantic quest to get back to that wonderful beginning, our new Christian tried to get busy with everything that made sense to him in the hope of restoring the joy that has begun to fade away. Bible study, books, revival meetings, giving of testimonies, and anything that a typical Christian would do. But despite occasional moments of riding high on wings of eagle, the burden seems to get heavier with increasing efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it possible that our recovered addict had found a different addiction to replace a previous one, albeit the new addiction is not nearly as harmful as the drug-based one but still shares the common purpose of masking an inner pain and emptiness? At this point our recovered addict is now experiencing the same struggles that many Christians face on a daily basis. The initial miracles though had helped launch the new believer on a fresh start, it got him on one traveled by the rest of mankind; he’s still in the end a sinner saved by the grace of God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;trying-to-finish-by-human-efforts&quot;&gt;Trying to finish by human efforts?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recovered addict will fare no better than someone who comes to Christ in a much less dramatic fashion, in how they should live out the remainder of their lives. The irony is, drug addicts or not, though virtually all entered the kingdom of God by grace and through faith with no claim of personal merits or efforts, they all ended up reverting back to the trusting of the flesh to walk the rest of the way. The apostle Paul expressed his frustration and anger at such stupidity like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;You foolish Galatians! Who has cast a spell on you? Before your eyes Jesus Christ was vividly portrayed as crucified! &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;The only thing I want to learn from you is this: Did you receive the Spirit by doing the works of the law or by believing what you heard? &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Are you so foolish? Although you began with the Spirit, are you now trying to finish by human effort? &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;Have you suffered so many things for nothing? if indeed it was for nothing. &lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;Does God then give you the Spirit and work miracles among you by your doing the works of the law or by your believing what you heard? (Galatians 3:1-6)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You began with the Spirit, solely by trusting in Christ through God’s grace, now you’re working hard to get to the finish line? The apostle Paul calls that foolishness. It takes but a fraction of a second for someone to be saved, like this prayer &lt;em&gt;“Jesus, remember me when you come in your kingdom” (Luke 23:43)&lt;/em&gt;. But walking with God from that point on may be a long time. So if you needed to rely 100% on God’s grace and His life-giving Spirit in your 100-yard dash—and it wasn’t even a dash as you were supposed to be already dead like the drug addict in our story—to become a Christian, how in the world are you now running a marathon relying on something else, something that comes from your own merits and ability and myriad other self-exalting attributes?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the principal cause for dissatisfaction in the lives of most Christians. They started out from nothing, but they now look inward and rely on their own ability to walk the rest of the way. They started out looking up to the Savior to save them from the bottomless pit of sins, or drug addiction as in the case of our man in this story, now they look within themselves to see if there is anything they can muster up to carry them on until they reach the finish line. This reverting back to the strength of the flesh is the root of all evil that wrecks havoc in the life of believers. It is not the drug addict’s relapses that make them fall from grace, it’s his self righteousness that is his true enemy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sin-empowered-by-the-law&quot;&gt;Sin empowered by the law&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why do people go back to the reliance on the flesh that was dead in sins  before they came to Christ, the same flesh that was useless against the power of drugs as in the case of our drug addict, and the flesh that is useless to the rest of mankind in providing them the righteousness they need to become citizens of the kingdom of God?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The root cause of this pervasive problem is the lack of a full understanding of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://vacsf.org/articles/Understanding-Forgiveness/&quot;&gt;forgiveness&lt;/a&gt; that Christ accomplished for them on the cross. Though they can correctly answer all questions in a theological examination, what they know in their hearts is far from what they say they believe.  They don’t really understand the meaning of what Jesus said before he took his last breath on the cross: &lt;em&gt;“It’s finished.”&lt;/em&gt; To them there are more sins to be forgiven, more work to be done before they can meet God. Though they accept the truth that Jesus died once-for-all for all the sins of mankind on the cross, they still fear that God is still holding their sins against them, that they’re not good enough to meet God yet, and countless other reasons for their feeling inadequate in their relationship with their Lord.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What then is the purpose of Christ’s death on the cross? What is the meaning of Christ’s dying once for all for all the sins of mankind? What did he mean when he said: “It’s finished”? I’m sure most Christians know the answers to these questions, but what they cannot reconcile, or rather what they don’t dare to place their full trust in, is the full resolution to the problem of sin at the cross, now and forevermore, that Christ’s death had given them a full right to become children of God, to be citizens of his kingdom, friends of God, to be considered blameless in his eyes, and everything else that is included in God’s promise: &lt;em&gt;“He who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all–how will he not also, along with him, graciously give us ALL THINGS?” (Romans 8:32)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And best of all, the ALL-THINGS includes the very presence of God indwelling in the hearts of all who call on the name of Jesus. Can you imagine God in you, the Holy Spirit in you, and Christ in you the hope of glory? And if God is in you, why in the world do you try to &lt;em&gt;“finish by human efforts”&lt;/em&gt; (Galatians 3:3)? Why do you try to “perfect” what Christ had already completed?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This lack of trust in the all-sufficiency of Christ has driven them back into the arm of the law as they hope that their obedience will make them right with God. But there is a catch. For there is no amount of obedience, of good works, of self sacrifices, will bridge that gap between a sense of lacking, of not having arrived, and a sense of rest, of knowing that God has fully accepted them and ready to receive them into the kingdom of God. On the other hand, The only thing that can bridge the gap is the work that Christ had already done on the cross. This work is not a continuing process, like sacrifices to be repeated over and over again, but a once-for-all act that makes you perfect in God’s sight. You will still sin, as a matter of fact you may fall back into drug addiction, not once but seventy times seven, yet God will always behold you through His beloved Son: &lt;em&gt;“This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. (Matthew 3:17)”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matthew 5:48 says this about God: &lt;em&gt;“Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.”&lt;/em&gt; Therefore, if Christ hasn’t already made you perfect, when will you be? One more revival meeting? One more communion? One more Bible verse to memorize? One more soul to win to Christ? No, if you aren’t already perfectly acceptable to God, you will never be. Today, you can claim Jesus’ promise to the thief on the cross: &lt;em&gt;“Truly I tell you, today you will be with me in paradise.” (Luke 23:43)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;you-will-be-free-indeed&quot;&gt;You will be free indeed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is how you walk with God after that wondrous encounter that brought you back from the dead. That no matter how you feel, or perform while still in the flesh, God’s love and acceptance of you will be the same yesterday, today, and forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;He who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus. (Phillipians 1:6)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Are we ever more in danger of teaching an error, than when we are combatting one? For when a teacher has the ‘antinomians’ in his sights, I find he often becomes a proponent of increased endeavour, talking of the ‘necessities’ required in a ‘holy’ life, instead of rather the holy inevitabilities to be expected in the regenerate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://vacsf.org/assets/images/danger-teaser.jpg&quot; style=&quot;border: 1px solid #cccccc; margin: 7px 15px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 148px; padding: 0px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;
He talks about the necessity of obeying God’s Word, instead of the inevitability, in the truly regenerate, of living it.  ‘Only holiness brings full joy’, one says.  But isn’t that putting the cart before the horse?  Isn’t it rather;  ‘Only joy (in believing), brings genuine holiness’?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Observe how the noted theologian quoted below takes verses of Scripture that describe the intention and purpose of the sovereign God, and render them as being contingent, and thereby provisional, and thereby uncertain, contingent upon the required actions of Man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New Testament tells us that we were chosen, redeemed, and called to be holy.  The Father &quot;chose us in him [Christ] before the creation of the world to be holy and blameless in his sight&quot; (Eph. 1:4). &quot;Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her to make her holy... to present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other blemish, but holy and blameless&quot; (Eph. 5:25- 27). &quot;It is God&#39;s will that you should be holy.... God did not call us to be impure, but to live a holy life&quot; (1 Thess. 4:3,7).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But who is the prime mover here?  God is!  Has the antinomian heresy turned a Calvinist theologian into an Arminian one?!  He so quickly forgets that life does not manifest itself because of requirements imposed upon it, but life manifests that life-principle which has been implanted within, by its creator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He continues;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sanctification is not an option, but an integral part of the salvation package, just as the repentance and consecration that lead into the pursuit of holiness are integral to the response for which the gospel calls. God&#39;s plan is to save us from sin, not in sin; therefore the need for holiness must be acknowledged and accepted.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sanctification is indeed an integral part of the ‘salvation package’, but are praise for some parts of the “package” to be due to God, and some parts due to Man?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The necessity of holiness follows from the revealed conditions of assurance. No one has a right to believe that they are partakers of God&#39;s salvation unless they walk the path of conscious, purposeful obedience and service to God. In 2 Peter 1:3-11 we learn that progress in sanctification is the only way to make one&#39;s calling and election sure (that is, to make certain of it).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, our antinomian antagonist rushes to turn what is the ‘election according to grace’ into an election according to the required conditions!    The verses he quotes do not show us how to ensure our election, but reveal what fruit shall indubitably be found in the elect. The inevitable fruits of regeneration are enumerated in Scripture as encouragements to some, and warnings to others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isaiah’s words (61:1-3) are just so evocative of our deliverance from the guilt and imprisonment of the law, into the joy of the new fruitful life God has created within us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon Me, because the LORD has anointed Me To preach good tidings to the poor; He has sent Me to heal the broken-hearted, To proclaim liberty to the captives, And the opening of the prison, to those who are bound;  To proclaim the acceptable year of the LORD, And the day of vengeance of our God; To comfort all who mourn,  To console those who mourn in Zion, To give them beauty for ashes, The oil of joy for mourning, The garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; That they may be called trees of righteousness, The planting of the LORD, that He may be glorified.” (Isaiah 61:1-3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Lord Jesus came to perform these promises, He said, and here is wonderfully revealed not merely His purpose, but also His method, which method is, He has made us His planting.  He has planted us as ‘trees of righteousness’, and just as an apple seed will surely produce an apple tree, so surely will those He has planted in righteousness, grow into trees of righteousness, leading to the eternal glorifying of His name.  There are no requirements demanded of Man here.  Here is the sovereign purpose, and certain joy of God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Truly;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Who has first given to Him, And it shall be repaid to him?”  For of Him, and through Him, and to Him, are all things,  to whom, be glory forever. Amen. (Romans 11:35-36)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;LORD, You will establish peace for us, For You have done all our works in us. (Isaiah 26:12)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them. (Ephesians 2:10)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Not unto us, O LORD, not unto us, But to Your name give glory. (Psalm 115:1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article was written by AFJ, a retired pastor who is still serving God in his part of the world. One day, AFJ found this website on the Internet and we became great friends due to our common understanding of what it means to be followers of Christ. This article is really an entire email that AFJ sent me perhaps as an affirmation of my writings so I won’t lose heart in this endeavor. Thank you brother AFJ. I have learned much from you.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;How do we disciple a new believer, one who first discovered that Jesus is their messiah and had come to receive the free gift of eternal life? How do we help them grow and mature? I believe that it should be their goal to discover what Jesus had &lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt; done for them, what he had &lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt; given to them, but unfortunately this is not the view point of the majority of Christian leaders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/nav&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-different-points-of-view&quot;&gt;The different points of view&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://vacsf.org/assets/images/forgiveness-teaser.jpg&quot; style=&quot;border: 1px solid #cccccc; margin: 7px 15px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 148px; padding: 0px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’re of the point of view that these new believers should start on the basis that they should now begin to live for God though they certainly must be motivated by what Christ had done for them. They must begin with leading a holy life, reducing the amount of sins in their lives, starting doing the things they should be doing, and refraining from doing the things they shouldn’t be doing. My point of view is that their focus should not be about what they should do for God, but about what God has done for them. This view is expressed rather extensively in the article &lt;a href=&quot;http://vacsf.org/articles/The-Will-of-God/&quot;&gt;The Will of God&lt;/a&gt; about what we already have in Christ, what we have received from Him as an inheritance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the precious inheritance that is guaranteed ours in Christ, forgiveness is first and foremost because without it salvation is impossible. A proper understanding of forgiveness can set you free in many ways and enable you to begin to walk into the new life that is before you in Christ Jesus. However a faulty understanding of forgiveness will paralyze you in your growth because forgiveness is truly the foundation of our faith, that Jesus died for our sins, and we’re forgiven because of what He did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt; Everyone who hears these words of mine and does them is like a wise man who built his house on rock. &lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt; The rain fell, the flood came, and the winds beat against that house, but it did not collapse because it had been founded on rock. &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt; Everyone who hears these words of mine and does not do them is like a foolish man who built his house on sand. &lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt; The rain fell, the flood came, and the winds beat against that house, and it collapsed; it was utterly destroyed! (Matthew 7:24-27)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A proper understanding of forgiveness is the foundation, the rock, upon which we build our faith, otherwise we’d be building it on the shifting sand of the flesh based view of sins and running in a mouse-wheel with lots of action without getting anywhere, to the point some may abandon the faith out of discouragement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-right-question-to-ask&quot;&gt;The right question to ask&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I were to ask a believer whether they believe that Jesus died for their sins past, present, and future, they would answer that they do believe it, however if I rephrased the question like this: “If you were to sin against God today, will He hold that sin against you?” they would most likely answer “YES,” and continue to explain that they would have to ask for forgiveness and find ways to redeem their trespasses, because if they don’t, their God may not bless them, or allow harm to come to them unless they do something about it. So we see that though theoretically, in their theological understanding, they believe one thing, in practice they live out their faith in the completely opposite way, that the issue of sin is still ever present and never completely dealt with at the cross at all. The issue of sin becomes to them a mouse-wheel of frustration that prevents them from maturing in the faith. To them the Christian life is still a continual process of dealing with sins and obtaining forgiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seeking-forgiveness&quot;&gt;Seeking forgiveness&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is useless; you are still in your sins. (1 Corinthians 15:17)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you believe that Christ had been raised? Let me ask again, do you really believe that He had been raised? If you indeed believe that He’s been raised, then you must also believe that you’re not in your sins anymore—this does not mean you either can’t, or you resolve not to, sin anymore, but it means God no longer holds your sins against you. This question may be asked a thousand times and though most Christians may answer yes equally as many times, I’m afraid they don’t really believe as they professed. Because if they do, why the obsession with trying to get forgiveness as a way of life if Christ is indeed raised? Let’s read the verse above more slowly and deliberately: &lt;em&gt;“if Christ has not been raised, your faith is useless; you are still in your sins.”&lt;/em&gt; Let’s put this verse another way, it is because of Christ’s resurrection from the dead that gives you freedom from sin, the freedom from the effect of sin, its condemnation, its standing between you and God, its deadly consequences (Romans 6:32). Christ’s resurrection guarantees that all your past, present, and future sins won’t stand between you and God, but it does not guarantee that you won’t sin again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Christ has risen, and you’re no longer in your sins, then what is standing between you and God? Your unbelief?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-sins-are-forgiven&quot;&gt;How sins are forgiven&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a period of time God gave the Israelites a temporary means for relief of sins: the offering of an unblemished lamb as an atonement. But an atonement does not provide the forgiveness of sins, because if it does, there would not have been a need for Christ. An atonement actually memorializes sins, it serves as a reminder that the worshiper is in need of the Savior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But in those sacrifices there is a &lt;u&gt;reminder of sins&lt;/u&gt; year after year. (Hebrews 10:3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the perfect once-for-all offering of the Son of God is not an atonement, but a propitiation through which our sins are actually remembered no more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;• For I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more. (Jeremiah 31:34)
• I will remember their sins and their lawless deeds no more. (Hebrews 10:17)
• There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. (Romans 8:1)
• Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come. (2 Corinthians 5:17)
• In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his grace. (Ephesians 1:7)
• in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins. (Colossians 1:14)
• Because Christ also suffered once for sins, the just for the unjust, to bring you to God, by being put to death in the flesh but by being made alive in the spirit. (1 Peter 3:18)
• I am writing to you, little children, that your sins have been forgiven because of his name. (1 John 2:12)
• And even though you were dead in your transgressions and in the uncircumcision of your flesh, he nevertheless made you alive with him, having forgiven all your transgressions. (Colossians 2:13)
• But God demonstrates his own love for us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. Much more then, because we have now been declared righteous by his blood, we will be saved through him from God’s wrath. For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son, how much more, since we have been reconciled, will we be saved by his life? (Romans 5:8-10)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The common denominator between the Old Covenant atonement and the New Covenant propitiation is the shedding of blood. And these are the only two ways God provided for the forgiveness of sins, with the old being a shadow of the true forgiveness that is ours in Christ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Indeed according to the law almost everything was purified with blood, and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness. (Hebrews 9:22)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without the shedding of blood, there is no forgiveness. The irony here is many Christians, and denominations, believe there is a way to get forgiveness without blood: an apology. But God had never provided such a way for the remission of sin. What that amounts to is no matter how well meaning is the action performed by the worshipper, remorse, recompense, repentance, obedience, rending of clothes, self beating, shedding tears of even the most contrite of hearts, a thousand recital of the most heartfelt prayers, will not achieve the forgiveness of sins without the shedding of blood, and the blood must be of no one else but the Lamb of God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In utilizing the so-called confession, or rather in practicality an apology, as means for the forgiveness of sins, the believer trivializes the enormity of sin of which even in the smallest amount is enough to cast mankind from the Garden of Eden. No, an apology won’t do as it does not meet the requirement of the shedding of blood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the continual seeking of the forgiveness of sins  proves that this believer is still in his sins, hence his belief, or his understanding, or his faith, in the resurrection of Christ is worthless (1 Corinthians 15:17), he only pays lip’s service to his belief in Christ’s resurrection but he doesn’t really believe that he’s been delivered from his sins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-forgiveness-is-necessary&quot;&gt;Why forgiveness is necessary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forgiveness is the prerequisite of salvation which is the restoration of life, the returning of the Holy Spirit, that had been lost in Adam (Ezekiel 18:20). Therefore in order for someone to inherit the kingdom of God, he must be completely without sins. And since we will still sin until the day we die, what we really need is to be completely forgiven now and forevermore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, to be no longer in sins doesn’t mean we stop sinning, but it does mean God no longer holds our sins against us, that He has already forgiven us even as He knows we cannot stop sinning. He’s no longer disgusted at us, or ashamed to call Himself our Father.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more. (Jeremiah 31:34)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The knowledge that God has already forgiven us without any condition sets us free to rightly relate to Him and to serve Him. Then we can do good works and serve God from love and not from fear of punishments or loss of blessings. It sets us free from the paralyzing fear of displeasing God. Perhaps here I should add that as fallen sinners we can never please God no matter how hard we try, except that we are in Him, the Lord Jesus Christ, who alone can please God in every way (Matthew 3:17).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about those who still live in sins, those who have to daily seek forgiveness from God? They may still be saved on the promise of God that those who call on the name of Christ will have eternal live, but until the day they meet God, their lives now are paralyzed with fear, with the uncertainty of God’s disappointment with them for the sins they still commit. That is no way to live, because Christ is risen and He’s granted that you don’t have to live in your sins anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-resistance-to-forgiveness&quot;&gt;The resistance to forgiveness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many reasons why people find it difficult to receive forgiveness or to grant forgiveness to others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;People intrinsically do not want to forgive others. They may say they do like in the Lord’s prayer, but given a right set of circumstances, perhaps they might want to kill those who have hurt them instead.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;People do not want God to forgive others. Most if not all folks have experienced things done to them unjustly and it’s only natural that they hold grudges against the perpetrators all their lives. We can easily see it in the book of Jonah.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;People do not want others to know that God had forgiven them in order that they may control or manipulate them, for if people know that God had forgiven them, the manipulators may lose the only leverage they had.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;People do not want to believe that God has forgiven them because they want to hold on to the law. But this is a great contradiction for a believer because the law has to do with punishment in the event of failure, and if God no longer holds our sins against us, what then is the role of the law? God has forgiven us because none of us can comply to even the smallest of the law, and yet so many in Christendom still parade the law as means to control the flesh.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-freedom-of-forgiveness&quot;&gt;The freedom of forgiveness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If God says He doesn’t hold our sins against us anymore, then why the issue of sins is still very much in the forefront of virtually all sermons across all mediums? It’s easy to spot a guilt-producing message, it may be cloaked in positive motivating words, but the end result is it leaves in the mind of the hearers a sense of missing the mark, of falling short of something, an expectation, especially if that something is dressed up as the will of God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story of Mary and Martha in Luke 10:38-42 demonstrates clearly the priority of forgiveness that gives Mary the freedom to relate to Jesus the way God intended. Martha must have been driven by guilt when she was doing good works, the works of serving Jesus and His disciples, the bondage she was experiencing expressed itself in her annoyance at Mary who was content at Jesus’ feet taking in His precious words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though this story didn’t mention forgiveness, it’s there if you can listen well. The forgiveness that Mary sensed from the Savior, much like that same forgiveness sensed by the Samaritan woman who drew water at Jacob’s well (John 4:1-26), gave them the freedom to rest at His feet. This is contrary to what we constantly hear from pulpits: Do’s. Lots of Do’s. To the point forgiveness sheepishly returns to its dusty corner on some book shelves of seminary as just a theological concept that has no relevance to real life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;41&lt;/sup&gt; Martha, Martha, the Lord answered, you are worried and upset about many things, &lt;sup&gt;42&lt;/sup&gt;but only one thing is needed. Mary has chosen what is better, and it will not be taken away from her. (Luke 10:41-42)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teachers of Bible place so much emphasis on other lesser things and neglect the “better” thing that Jesus commended Mary for. Unlike Jesus, they lead the Mary’s among us away from Christ to the things that He may have already prepared for them in advance. Let’s consider the following verses that also tell us what the better thing is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;For by grace you are saved through faith, and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God; &lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;it is not from works, so that no one can boast. &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;For we are his workmanship, having been created in Christ Jesus for good works that God prepared beforehand so we may do them. (Ephesians 2:8-10)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not a coincidence that these verses discourage us from trusting in good works for salvation, then in the same context assure us that it is God who will give us works to do that He’s already prepared beforehand. The forgiveness, or our full appreciation of it, must come first before anything else, otherwise trying to please an unforgiving God is slavery that has no place in the heart of God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-fear-of-forgiveness&quot;&gt;The fear of forgiveness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The large majority of Bible teachers are afraid of teaching God’s forgiveness to its full extent. It’s not about the forgiveness that is dispensed in small doses for particular transgressions, but the total forgiveness of sins that completely sets the sinner free from the fear of ever being condemned again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their rationale is a full knowledge of God’s forgiveness will give people a license to sin. While this may be true, it does not justify hiding this truth from even one person who might through the knowledge of God’s full pardon know God in proportion with what He wants to reveal through the cross.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Realistically can the covering of God’s light of forgiveness make better people out of us? For so long people mistakenly believe that the law keep people from sins, but the Bible says otherwise:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;• The law was brought in so that the trespass might increase. (Romans 5:20)
• For when we were in the realm of the flesh, the sinful passions aroused by the law were at work in us, so that we bore fruit for death. (Romans 7:5)
• The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law. (1 Corinthians 15:56)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The law actually produces the opposite effect of what people normally think. It actually increases sin so their depravity is exposed to the point all knees shall bow and call Jesus Christ Lord. That is the purpose of the law. It is the teacher to lead us to Christ, and then it’s done its job (Galatians 3:24) when God gets a hold of us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without a full trust and embrace of God’s forgiveness no one can really know God, because that’s how He’s shown Himself to the world. Forgiveness has to do with love and trust, while punishment has to do with the law and condemnation (1 John 4:18).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;antinomianism&quot;&gt;Antinomianism&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people believe that complete forgiveness cannot be taught because &lt;em&gt;“it leads an individual to the point of complete practical disregard for the law of God and a callous lack of concern for violating it.”&lt;/em&gt; This is a direct quote from a very well known preacher of grace and many people fully trust it to be true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s entirely possible that there are folks who cite God’s complete forgiveness to justify their sinful lifestyles, but in reality have you ever met one who does that? Can God who dwells in the heart of a true believer allow that to happen? Neither can an unbeliever, a normal person without serious psychological problem, overcome the power of his conscience so he may eradicate any trace of guilt. It’s rare to find antinomianism even in unbelievers because they, too, have the law of God in their conscience (Romans 2:14).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you believe in the truth that God has already completely forgiven those who trust in Him, should you because of some, even ninety nine out of a hundred, who may take advantage of it and fall into antinomianism, hide this truth from all? No, you should not. Because in doing so, you will prevent all from ever knowing God for who He really is. I’d rather risk the ninety nine and remove the stumbling block for the one so he may know his God. This knowledge of God’s total forgiveness is the only way for anyone to know God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To hide this truth from others is actually a complete disregard for the new law of God, the law of the spirit of life, the law with God’s total forgiveness as its foundation, the law which states that God no longer holds your sins against you, because Jesus paid it all, now and forevermore. Sadly so many Bible teachers still try to hold their flocks captives with the false gospel that hides the ever forgiving power of the cross of Christ. These folks indulge their own personal self interest by lying to you concerning this truth. They do that to put you under their control and influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;“The days are coming,” declares the Lord,
    “when I will make a &lt;strong&gt;new&lt;/strong&gt; covenant
with the people of Israel
    and with the people of Judah.
&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It will not be like&lt;/strong&gt; the covenant
    I made with their ancestors
when I took them by the hand
    to lead them out of Egypt,
because they broke my covenant,
    though I was a husband to[a] them,[b]”
declares the Lord.
&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt;“This is the covenant I will make with the people of Israel
    after that time,” declares the Lord.
“I will put my law in their minds
    and write it on their hearts.
I will be their God,
    and they will be my people.
&lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt;No longer will they teach their neighbor,
    or say to one another, ‘Know the Lord,’
because they will all know me,
    from the least of them to the greatest,”
declares the Lord.
“For I will forgive their wickedness
    and will &lt;strong&gt;remember their sins no more&lt;/strong&gt;. (Jeremiah 31:31-34)”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the covenant you’re living under is anything like the old covenant, it’s not the new covenant. In the new covenant, God will &lt;em&gt;“remember your sins no more.”&lt;/em&gt; And if this is true and you believe it, what else is there to forgive? Or does God still hold your sins against you? Then you don’t know God at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The work of forgiving those who come to the cross is completed. IT’S FINISHED!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;license-to-sin&quot;&gt;License to sin&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The labeling of the teaching of God’s total forgiveness of sins as giving people a license to sin is categorically erroneous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us use a real life example such as a driver’s license. This license is given to a driver with rules governing what he can, or cannot, do in order to maintain safety. The issuance of this license also imply penalty upon failure to obey driving rules and how such penalty may be redeemed so the driver can continue to drive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this sense, it is the purveyor of the law who is giving people license to sin, as they give people a set of rules on what they can or cannot do, along with penalties which may be the threat of the loss of salvation or of blessings, and means for redemption which is generally accepted as a confession of sins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These folks gives people an illusion of a forgiveness of sins through confession that does not deliver what it promises. In the “How sins are forgiven” above we learned that in order for sins to be forgiven there must be the shedding of blood, and it must be the blood of the Son of God, not of bulls or goats. Then how is it that a mere verbal confession, or a more down to earth expression of an apology, can achieve what only Christ could?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This confession as means for forgiveness is not only a license to sin, it is a deceptive one at best. We will delve into this topic of sin confession in the next section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;john-19&quot;&gt;1 John 1:9&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But if we confess our sins, he is faithful and righteous, forgiving us our sins and cleansing us from all unrighteousness. (1 John 1:9)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This verse is normally used to support the idea that a confession, an apology, can be used to obtain forgiveness. As we’ve discussed previously, this approach shows its adherent do not take sins seriously. If it took Jesus on the cross to forgive our sins, how is it that now we can achieve the same thing just by mere confession? The Bible says that the wages of sin is death(Romans 6:23), now we trivialize them to be just simple apologies. This circumventing of the cross is from the devil, and yet it is predominantly the teaching of the church.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you believe 1 John 1:9 is the way to achieve forgiveness as a way of life, you have no life. This verse has no application to a believer’s life. Let us find out why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Dr. John Best, a Greek scholar, of the Dallas Theological Seminary, this verse should be translated from Greek to English as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I don’t know if you are ever to come to your senses and agree with God concerning your sins, but if any time, today, tomorrow, or whenever you should decide to turn to Him, God can be depended upon to &lt;strong&gt;have forgiven&lt;/strong&gt; your sins and to have cleansed you of all unrighteousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And all this is in the &lt;u&gt;past tense&lt;/u&gt; in the context of salvation. You are already the beneficiary of this forgiveness that he has ALREADY given to you. How? By the death of Jesus on the cross. When? Two thousand years ago. This was the execution of forgiveness for humanity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let’s go back to the verse before 1 John 1:9.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If we say we do not bear the guilt of sin, we are deceiving ourselves and the truth is not in us. (1 John 1:8)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What kind of a person thinks he has no sins? It’s obvious this is not a saved person, an unbeliever, because there is no believer who thinks he has no sins. What then should this person do if he wants to be saved? He must acknowledge that he’s a sinner, that he’s not without sins, and confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, that apart from what He did on the cross he has no hope of salvation. In this sense, and it is the context intended by the author, this confession is the confession of faith, to obtain the forgiveness once for all for salvation, not the kind practiced daily by most Christians. In practicing the daily confession for forgiveness of sins, the Christians say Jesus’ death on the cross was insufficient and they have to add to it with further confessions until the day they die. This practice is another gospel which is is not what the apostle Paul was preaching. The person who holds this belief must answer: Is death the wage of sin, or is it a confession?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, if we move forward to the beginning of the next chapter, we’ll see even more proof that the means of forgiveness is not a confession, but something else, something that lines up perfectly with the foundation of the gospel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;My dear children, I write this to you so that you will not sin. But if anybody does sin, we have an advocate with the Father—Jesus Christ, the Righteous One. &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for ours but also for the sins of the whole world (1 John 2:1-2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does the verse say: if you do sin, confess? No. It says: if you do sin, you have Christ who is your defender. There is no mentioning here of any penalty, such as a confession, of any method of recompense, or even forgiveness, but a line of defense. And the defense doesn’t say: please forgive this child, but it says: he’s not guilty, because I, Jesus, paid it all already at Calvary. This is the reason why the apostle Paul boldly wrote, without any fear of anyone taking advantage of his pronouncement, the following verse that was revealed to him from God Himself:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus (Romans 8:1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there is now no condemnation, then what is forgiveness for? Therefore 1 John 1:9 is a call to an unbeliever to come to an agreement with God that he’s a sinner in need of God’s grace. It’s not for a believer, and it has no application in a believer’s life such as confession to obtain forgiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-confession&quot;&gt;Why confession?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is this practice of confession so prevalent if it’s not in the Bible? There are several reasons from both the practitioners and those that promote it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some say they experience a sense of peace after they confess their sins. Granted there might be positive psychological effects from being able to unload guilty feelings, but in my experience, the benefit doesn’t last. Additionally, the practice does not bring the forgiveness of sins as it’s purported to do. The Bible says that there must be the shedding of blood for sins to be forgiven, but according to Hebrews 10:26, shedding of animal blood, or even the blood of Christ, is no longer accepted by God; it is finished with Christ. For an unbeliever, his sins can be forgiven once for all through faith in Christ, for believer, he’s already forgiven now and forevermore.  Therefore for a Christian, if God says He doesn’t remember their sins no more (Jeremiah 31:34; Hebrews 8:12), what then can be achieved by reminding Him of our sins through the act of confession?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For leaders in a legalistic church, holding their flocks under sin give them the benefit of their dependence on them, it provides job security. These leaders may or may not know about the truth that the issue of sins has been resolved at the cross two thousand years ago; if they don’t, it’s not only that they walk in confusion, they also lead others on the same path; if they do and they chose to disregard the truth and chose to lead others astray … ? At any rate, the tendency to use guilt to control others is common within or without Christianity. Confession is a leash that prevents Christians from realizing the freedom they have through Christ’s total forgiveness of their sins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lords-prayer&quot;&gt;The Lord’s prayer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the Lord’s prayer in Matthew 6:14-15, we read:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; For if you forgive other people when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; But if you do not forgive others their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins. (Matthew 6:14-15)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In these verses God gives us a recipe for receiving forgiveness from Him: forgive others when they sin against us. But if we know ourselves, can we honestly say that we’ll be able to forgive anyone under any circumstances? Will we be able to forgive someone who might possibly commit the worst act of atrocity upon us?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, let us not forget that in order for anyone to enter the kingdom of God, he must be completely forgiven by God, to the point he can be as perfect as is required by God (Matthew 5:48). Jesus declared this requirement of perfection after He gave what we now call the Sermon on the Mount. He raised the bar so high with the intention of demolishing all prideful arrogance of those who think they can somehow achieve the perfection of God with their own fleshly efforts. So it was with the Matthew verses quoted above. Jesus didn’t give that requirement as a golden rule for us to follow, but as a means to put us where we really belong: sinners in need of God’s grace and mercies, because no one even come close to being able to forgive anyone in its truest meaning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;being-forgiven&quot;&gt;Being forgiven&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The universal truth is no one is righteous, or to put it another way, everyone is a sinner. Except for some whose conscience does not seem to have a strong influence on their lives, the rest will get on some paths trying to become better people, through obedience, repentance, or other ways to reach this noble goal. If there is even a slightest hint of honesty in the hearts of such people, they would soon come to the place of realization that the effort to become better people, to banish sins from their lives, is futile. However, there may be others who are more persistent their quest for personal excellence even until the time they lay on their deathbed. The strangest thing is even though all will never have achieved their state of perfection, they attempt to teach others how to do what they know will end in failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The honest seekers will come to a place where they realize they are in need of God’s forgiveness. They realize all their efforts in obedience and repentance will not bring them any closer to the state of perfection. They fell too far short of the glory of God. What they need is God’s forgiveness. Much like a drug addict under the spell of the powerful mind altering substance becomes absolute slave to it. Obedience and repentance to a Christian is like pep talk or imploring as they will fall on deaf ears, as the only thing an addict hears is the voice of his delusional mind which cannot be trusted. Addicts or sinners, they need forgiveness for the sins they WILL commit.  An addict doesn’t need to confess whenever he fails under the spell of the cravings for drugs. He knows it, and he hates it. He desperately needs to get out from under the bondage of drugs that is stronger than steel. But there is something stronger than steel: it’s God’s enduring forgiveness that sets him free and empowers him to begin anew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;forgiving-others-and-conclusion&quot;&gt;Forgiving others, and conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is a debt forgiven? If a debt can be paid up but the creditor decides not to pursue payment, then it’s not a forgiveness of the debt, but a gift. A debt is only truly forgiven if the debtor cannot repay it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from money, there are debts that one person owes another that cannot be repaid. Such debt as the taking of lives, acts of injustice, abuse, etc., cannot be repaid with mere apologies, or confessions as usually offered by Christians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What then does Jesus mean when he asks us to forgive others? We forgive others, with a firm conviction that they can never repay, in the same way God has forgiven us. I don’t know about you but I’m not sure if I can really forgive someone the way God does. I can’t guarantee that there won’t be moments I secretly require a payment in my heart, when I entertain the thoughts of vengeance, but I know God can forgive as He said. He sent His Son to the cross even when we were still sinners like the drug addict howling in agony and in a frantic search for his next fix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not an easy thing to know and fully believe that God has forgiven us and has cast our sins as far as the East is from the West, as the bottom of the sea is from the high heavens. It’s not easy to believe that God no longer counts our sins against us. But we can only forgive others in proportion to how we know and experience God’s forgiveness for us. We cannot outdo Him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what are you doing whispering in God’s ears what God had banished by sending His precious Son to the cross?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;credit&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I owe a debt of gratitude to brother Aaron Budjen who produced a life changing series of 12 sermons with the same title: &lt;a href=&quot;http://livinggodministries.net&quot;&gt;“Understanding Forgiveness”&lt;/a&gt;—please click on the link at left to access the full series in mp3 format—that this article is derived from as well as much of its content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I was near completion of this writing, a wonderful opportunity came with a request that I serve as an editor for a book being translated into English from Vietnamese. The book consists of testimonies from people who suffered from drug addiction but had been delivered miraculously by the power of the love of God. The testimonies that I had the privilege to edit gave me just the perfect closing thoughts to bring home the key concept of God’s complete forgiveness that took a while to build. Thank you the VCRM team for making me a part of this wonderful project.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;!-- &lt;p&gt;The Lord’s Supper and the Christian Communion. Understanding it from the Passover context.&lt;/p&gt;
 --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Christians usually are advised to examine themselves in preparation for the communion based on the passage in 1 Corinthians 11, but most assuredly the passage they should base it on is Matthew 26 which recorded what is known as The Lord’s Supper, which in turn should be understood from the context of the Passover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;matthew-2617-30&quot;&gt;Matthew 26:17-30&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;On the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to Jesus and asked, “Where do you want us to make preparations for you to eat the Passover?”
&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;He replied, “Go into the city to a certain man and tell him, ‘The Teacher says: My appointed time is near. I am going to celebrate the Passover with my disciples at your house.’” &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;So the disciples did as Jesus had directed them and prepared the Passover.
&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;When evening came, Jesus was reclining at the table with the Twelve. &lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;And while they were eating, he said, “Truly I tell you, one of you will betray me.”
&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;They were very sad and began to say to him one after the other, “Surely you don’t mean me, Lord?”
&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;Jesus replied, “The one who has dipped his hand into the bowl with me will betray me. &lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him. But woe to that man who betrays the Son of Man! It would be better for him if he had not been born.”
&lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt;Then Judas, the one who would betray him, said, “Surely you don’t mean me, Rabbi?”
Jesus answered, “You have said so.”
&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;While they were eating, Jesus took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and gave it to his disciples, saying, “Take and eat; this is my body.”
&lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt;Then he took a cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, saying, “Drink from it, all of you. &lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt;This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins. &lt;sup&gt;29&lt;/sup&gt;I tell you, I will not drink from this fruit of the vine from now on until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father’s kingdom.”
&lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt;When they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives. (Matthew 26:17-30)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/nav&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-communion&quot;&gt;The Communion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://vacsf.org/assets/images/communion-teaser.jpg&quot; style=&quot;border: 1px solid #cccccc; margin: 7px 15px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 148px; padding: 0px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;
This passage along with another passage in 1 Corinthians 11:27-29 are regularly used to prepare the congregation prior to their receiving of the communion bread and wine. There are a few points of emphasis in these passages but perhaps the main focus is placed on &lt;em&gt;“unworthy manner”&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;“self examination”&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;“judgement”&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt;So then, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an &lt;u&gt;unworthy manner&lt;/u&gt; will be guilty of sinning against the body and blood of the Lord. &lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt;Everyone ought to &lt;u&gt;examine themselves&lt;/u&gt; before they eat of the bread and drink from the cup. &lt;sup&gt;29&lt;/sup&gt;For those who eat and drink without discerning the body of Christ eat and drink &lt;u&gt;judgment&lt;/u&gt; on themselves.” (1 Corinthians 11:27-29)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had always thought this was the right way to prepare myself for communion for decades before I came to a full grasp of law and grace that encouraged me to take another look at it from the whole context.  No wonder communion Sunday was for me such a mixture of a heavy heart and a longing for deliverance that was never realized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’d be all standing up while the Corinthians passage is read, then following its admonition we’d examine ourselves to see if we’re now worthy to receive the Lord’s body and blood. There is no need for any explanation, we each would summon our internal judge, our conscience, during this time of quiet reflection, to evaluate our worthiness before we receive the communion articles. It’s not clear what we’ve done during the week, perhaps for an average Christian we’ve done nothing out of the ordinary except getting up in the morning to prepare and then go through the challenges of the day in family and in the workplace.  Just mundane and routine stuff. But if they feel these mundane and routine stuff is less than what they think is the Lord’s will for their lives, then guilt begins to take hold, which would explain how many feel before the communion: We’re unworthy. No matter which way you look at it, you end up feeling unworthy, but you receive the communion anyway while hoping this act of eating the bread and drinking the grape juice would provide a certain amount of relief for your sin-sicked soul.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this is a wrong application of the Corinthians passage. Paul wrote this passage to address an issue of bad conducts of some folks who come to eat together without concern for others. Let’s read from the passage that just precedes the call for the communion receivers to examine themselves:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;So then, when you come together, it is not the Lord’s Supper you eat, &lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;for when you are eating, some of you go ahead with your own private suppers. As a result, one person remains hungry and another gets drunk. &lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;Don’t you have homes to eat and drink in? Or do you despise the church of God by humiliating those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you? Certainly not in this matter!” (1 Corinthians 11:20-22)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to see that the self examination has nothing to do with anything other than the immediate act of the receiving of communion. But one may ask: What about sins during the days, or weeks, leading to communion Sunday?  The answer will be that we must trust that the Lord will work with the individuals in His time and according to His way in His infinite wisdom, all we know is the issue with communion in this context is just what we read from the passage. As a matter of fact, this passage should not even be read during communion today as it’s unlikely that people will fight for the little chip and a little cup of grape juice to warrant such exhortation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now with the issue of self examination and worthiness concerning communion out of the way, we can focus on the true meaning of the Lord’s Supper with the hope that a proper understanding will gladdens our hearts as we’re wonderfully reminded of what great thing Christ has done for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-passover&quot;&gt;The Passover&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Lord’s Supper is in essence the Passover observance as we read in verse 18: &lt;em&gt;“My appointed time is near. I am going to celebrate the Passover with my disciples at your house. (Matthew 26:18)”&lt;/em&gt; However this Passover now has a different New Covenant meaning as we shall see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God gave the Isrealites a commandment to remember the bondage they had when they were still in Egypt and how He delivered them and brought them to the promised land. In this Passover observance a lamb which must be unblemished must be specially chosen to be offered as a sacrifice, and it must be consumed following a strict guideline. The Passover must be observed on the 14th day of the month in the Jewish calendar which was based on the barley harvest and the day of the most recent full moon and was different from year to year. Anyone who missed this day must return to Jerusalem on the 14th day of the following month to observe the festival. This is a very important commandment that must be observed by everyone in Israel in Jerusalem or they will be cut off from the nation for the rest of their lives, and it must be observed only in Jerusalem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is much more  that can be that can be said about the historical background and meaning of the Old Covenant Passover which would help us appreciate much more the meaning of the New Covenant version of it that is either known as the Lord’s Supper or the Communion that Christian churches observe periodically. However the main goal of this writing is to point out misinterpretations and misapplications of the Lord’s Supper that create much confusion and deprive the joy of salvation that should have been brought forth from the observance of this blessed event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;under-the-old-covenant&quot;&gt;Under the Old Covenant&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The name Passover describes the event surrounding the tenth plague after which the Egyptian Pharaoh capitulated and set his captives free.  On the night of this tenth plague when the Lord would have unleashed his wrath upon Egypt to take away all their first born sons, the Israelites were instructed to apply lamb’s blood above every door that leads into their homes in which case the Lord would &lt;strong&gt;passover&lt;/strong&gt; them and they would be spared. But for the Egyptians:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“About midnight I will go throughout Egypt. Every firstborn in Egypt will die, from the firstborn son of Pharaoh, who sits on the throne, to the firstborn of the slave girl, who is at her hand mill, and all the firstborn of the cattle as well. There will be loud wailing throughout Egypt—worse than there has ever been or ever will be again.” (Exodus 11:4–6)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;under-the-new-covenant&quot;&gt;Under the New Covenant&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the blood that sets us apart from the world is not one of ordinary lamb, but of the Lamb of God, and though it does not spare us of physical death, it gives us eternal life through the indwelling Holy Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkled on those who are ceremonially unclean sanctify them so that they are outwardly clean. How much more, then, will the &lt;strong&gt;blood of Christ&lt;/strong&gt;, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself unblemished to God, cleanse our consciences from acts that lead to death, so that we may serve the living God! (Hebrews 9:13-14)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;whats-the-difference&quot;&gt;What’s the difference?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though the Old Covenant’s blood blessed the Israelites, or those who lived under the law, in the flesh by sparing them physical death, the New Covenant’s blood gives them life everlasting. The old only made them ceremonially and outwardly clean, the new actually made it possible for us to serve God. The shedding of the old blood must be continually repeated while the new blood is shed once for all for the sins of the whole world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day after day&lt;/strong&gt; every priest stands and performs his religious duties; &lt;strong&gt;again and again&lt;/strong&gt; he offers the same sacrifices, &lt;strong&gt;which can never take away sins&lt;/strong&gt;. (Hebrews 10:11)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;But when this Priest had offered for all time &lt;strong&gt;one sacrifice&lt;/strong&gt; for sins, He sat down at the right hand of God (Hebrews 10:12)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you notice a critical difference between the Old and the New in how sins are taken away? No matter how earnest and sincere the worshipper is, any sacrifice whatsoever from him, be it a burnt sacrifice, or a confession of sin, or even an attempt to recompense for a bad deed, a huge amount of remorse, self flagellation, a composition or singing of a most beautiful song of praise, or whatever a sin wrecked soul can conjure up to make amends, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;none&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; of these things can &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;take away sins&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Only Christ can. Of course you should do all those things listed above because they’re good for your well being, but keep in mind that they don’t take away your sins which stand between you and God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;in-remembrance&quot;&gt;In remembrance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luke 22 had the same account of the Lord’s Supper with some additional important details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;Now when the hour came, Jesus took his place at the table and the apostles joined him.  &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;And he said to them, “I have earnestly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer.  &lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;For I tell you, I &lt;strong&gt;will not eat it again until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God&lt;/strong&gt;.”  &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;Then he took a cup, and after giving thanks he said, “Take this and divide it among yourselves.  &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;For I tell you that from now on I &lt;strong&gt;will not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes&lt;/strong&gt;.”  &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;Then he took bread, and after giving thanks he broke it and gave it to them, saying, “This is my body which is given for you. Do this in &lt;strong&gt;remembrance of me&lt;/strong&gt;.”  &lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;And in the same way he took the cup after they had eaten, saying, “This cup that is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood. (Luke 22:14-20)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Old Covenant Passover, the people were reminded year after year of the terrible sufferings they had while in Egypt, and the passing over of the Lord which was but a shadow of the true Passover accomplished for us in Christ. Moreover this is not a type of joyful remembrance as one had hoped for. All the strict rules governing the observance of this event, and what it reminds people of, makes it anything but joyful. The Hebrews verse below puts it so succinctly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But in those sacrifices there is a &lt;strong&gt;reminder of sins&lt;/strong&gt; year after year. (Hebrews 10:3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the Passover that Jesus conducted ushered in a new era of remembrances not of sins but of the Savior, not of unavoidable and repeated human failures but of perfect completion of the Christ who came to fulfill all requirements of the law. How could he do that? The Passover was such an important part of Jewish life, and now He’s telling them to forget it all but remember Him instead? Yes, that was exactly what He said: &lt;em&gt;“Do this in remembrance of me.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And contrary to the Old Passover when sacrifices must be offered repeatedly year after year, Christ observed it once and put an end to it when He went to the cross. One thing that remains to be revealed to us is when He said: &lt;em&gt;“I will not eat it again until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.”&lt;/em&gt; There is much prophetic inference at what Jesus said here, if this is a special Passover that ends all Old Covenant Passovers, what will be the one when the kingdom of God comes? We’ll never know until then, but what we know is it will probably be like the welcoming party for the prodigal son.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;i-am-worthy&quot;&gt;I am worthy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve seen so far that the New Covenant Passover, or the Lord’s Supper, or the Communion as we now know it, is not at all about us, but about the One who came to shed His blood for the sins of the world. Therefore the question that should be raised about the observance of the Lord Supper should be whether the participants understand what it means, whether they know that it’s no longer a ritual, a sacrament, or a religious duty, but a time of joyful reflection upon what a great salvation Christ has achieved for us, unencumbered by forms and strict guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even in the context of 1 Corinthians 11, these folks may have behaved in a manner unworthy of communion participants, they were every bit worthy as anyone to receive the communion wine and bread, because Christ has paid it all for them as well. The erroneous interpretation of 1 Corinthians 11 concerning communion worthiness has caused so many to stumble, instead of coming to the celebration with hearts full of joy in the remembrance of Christ act of redemtion, they dreaded that there might be sins in their lives that might cause the Lord to take them out and kill them. As a matter of fact, upon such reminder of self introspection no one can be certain that they are 100% certain of their worthiness before receiving the communion. This casts a long shadow on an otherwise a joyful event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What will communion participants be reminded of when the worship leader ask them to examine their hearts? Will they be like the Israelites who still lived under the law who remember their sins and trespasses when they were still under slavery in Egypt? Absolutely not. Jesus asked them to &lt;em&gt;“remember me.”&lt;/em&gt; On the one hand is the remembrance of sins, while on the other a remembrance of a deliverance from sins thanks to Christ. Are you still living under the Old Covenant, or are you now relating to God through the New Covenant?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;By calling this covenant “new,” he has made the first one obsolete; and what is obsolete and outdated will soon disappear. (Hebrews 8:13)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    &lt;!-- &lt;p&gt;This article will show that traditional interpretation of this parable is far from what Jesus had in mind.  The oil in the virgins’ lamps has nothing to do with sins or works.&lt;/p&gt;
 --&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;matthew-251-13&quot;&gt;Matthew 25:1-13&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“At that time the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom. 2 Five of them were foolish and five were wise. 3 The foolish ones took their lamps but &lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;did not take any oil&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt; with them. 4 The wise ones, however, took oil in jars along with their lamps. 5 The bridegroom was a long time in coming, and they all became drowsy and fell asleep.
6 “At midnight the cry rang out: ‘Here’s the bridegroom! Come out to meet him!’
7 “Then all the virgins woke up and trimmed their lamps. 8 The foolish ones said to the wise, ‘Give us some of your oil; our lamps are going out.’
9 “‘No,’ they replied, ‘there may not be enough for both us and you. Instead, go to those who sell oil and buy some for yourselves.’
10 “But while they were on their way to buy the oil, the bridegroom arrived. The virgins who were ready went in with him to the wedding banquet. And the door was shut.
11 “Later the others also came. ‘Lord, Lord,’ they said, ‘open the door for us!’
12 “But he replied, ‘Truly I tell you, I don’t know you.’
13 “Therefore &lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;keep watch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;, because you do not know the day or the hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;watchfulness&quot;&gt;Watchfulness&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://vacsf.org/assets/images/ten-virgins-teaser.jpg&quot; style=&quot;border: 1px solid #cccccc; margin: 7px 15px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 148px; padding: 0px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;
Let us consider some popular commentaries on the parable of the ten virgins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Matthew Henry: &lt;em&gt;“Many have a lamp of profession in their hands, but have not, in their hearts, sound knowledge and settled resolution, which are needed to carry them through the &lt;u&gt;services and trials&lt;/u&gt; of the present state. Their hearts are not stored with &lt;u&gt;holy dispositions&lt;/u&gt;, by the new-creating Spirit of God. Our light must shine before men in &lt;u&gt;good works&lt;/u&gt;; but this is not likely to be long done, unless there is a fixed, active principle in the heart, of faith in Christ, and &lt;u&gt;love to God and our brethren&lt;/u&gt;. They all &lt;u&gt;slumbered and slept&lt;/u&gt;.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Gill’s Exposition: &lt;em&gt;“the Christian church was then in such a &lt;u&gt;lukewarm, drowsy, and sleepy&lt;/u&gt; condition …  the difference between &lt;u&gt;nominal and real&lt;/u&gt; Christians … how &lt;u&gt;watchful&lt;/u&gt; the saints should be, that they be not surprised with it (the second coming of Christ).”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cambridge Bible: &lt;em&gt;“This parable is another warning for the disciples of Christ “&lt;u&gt;to watch&lt;/u&gt;.””&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This parable is regularly used to exhort Christians to be watchful if they don’t want to be like the foolish virgins who didn’t have oil in their lamps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the fact that the key ingredient that the virgins needed was oil for their lamps, it is not at all reflected in reality, in how most Christians understand and live out in their walks with God. Virtually all Bible commentaries focus on various things covered under the umbrella of “watchfulness”, but none of these things were mentioned in the parable; such things as services and trials, holy dispositions, good works, etc.. The tendency to associate the oil with everything else but the Holy Spirit seems to be affirmed in most Christian communications including weekly Sunday sermons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exhortation for Christians to be watchful seems to be just a means to achieve the end of getting positive evaluations of their lives. The “oil” is therefore understood as the amount of good works performed or the amount of sins reduced. Why is there such a disparity between what people believe and what they practice? Why the instinctive interpretation of “oil” as works that goes against the very clear and undeniable truth set forth in Scriptures that oil really does represent the Holy Spirit?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;God &lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;anointed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt; Jesus of Nazareth with the &lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Holy Spirit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt; and with power, who went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with Him (Acts 10:38).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore if “oil” is to be understood as the Holy Spirit, then “watchfulness” must take on a different meaning. It cannot mean a type of watchfulness where once someone falls into a slumber his “oil”—Holy Spirit—might be stolen away from him. Just think about it, can the Holy Spirit—eternal life, salvation, the status of being children of God, righteousness in Christ, etc.—be so vulnerable to human failures and fickleness? If the answer is “No,” then this watchfulness must not mean the vigilance against the loss of “oil,” but of making sure one has “oil” in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;oil-as-the-holy-spirit&quot;&gt;Oil as the Holy Spirit&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When God created Adam from a lump of clay, He breathed into him and Adam became a living being. This breath of life was the Holy Spirit. Then when Adam sinned, God took His Holy Spirit away so he became a walking dead; though he was still physically alive, he was spiritually dead to God. Now in this age of grace God once again gives His Holy Spirit back to those who reconcile with Him through His Son. This life—Holy Spirit—is a gift from God to man who was dead in sins and trespasses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And you also were included in Christ when you heard the message of truth, the gospel of your salvation. When you believed, you were marked in him with a seal, the promised Holy Spirit. (Ephesians 1:13)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now being infused again with the life of God in the person of the Holy Spirit, man becomes alive again as they were at the beginning of time. The Holy Spirit becomes to man the proof that they’re now fit for God’s kingdom, in the same manner with the oil in Jesus’ parable. With the Holy Spirit as a seal of their redemption they now possess a life that is eternal, and what is eternal cannot be lost, because if it can be lost, it is not eternal, if their sins can be forgiven once for all by the blood of the Lamb of God, they cannot be unforgiven ever again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as we read again at the beginning of the parable, the foolish virgins didn’t run out of oil, they simply didn’t get any oil when they picked up their lamps. They later told the wise virgins that they ran out of oil just to hide the fact that they didn’t get any of it in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The foolish ones took their lamps but &lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;did not take any oil&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt; with them. (Matthew 25:3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;subjective-evaluation&quot;&gt;Subjective evaluation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s pick out key concepts from the commentaries quoted above: &lt;em&gt;services and trials, holy disposition, good works, love to God and our brethren, slumbered and slept, lukewarm, drowsy, and sleepy condition, the difference between nominal and real Christians, and finally watchfulness&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interesting thing is “oil” is never mentioned in any of these commentaries, except when it is mentioned for historical retelling of a wedding. In this manner of interpretation, the expositors made these characteristics to be the same thing as the oil in the virgins’ lamps, or the lack there of. This creates real problems for believers, because if the “oil” they need for their lamps are the same as these things that I call “subjective evaluations,” &lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ALL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt; will have failed at one point or another. They will never know if they will have enough oil when their Christ comes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s take “services and trials” as a requirement expressed by Matthew Henry. Are the believers encouraged to look for ways to serve God, and to place themselves in trying circumstances, in order to have enough “oil” for their lamps? How do they know what is to do and how much is enough?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now comes “holy disposition.” Is there a clear and unchangeable definition of what is a holy disposition that can be used as a standard to show whether a person has enough oil in his lamp? What is perceived as a holy disposition to a person, or a tradition, may not be so to another. The Pharisees may actually be perceived as possessing more holy disposition than Jesus himself. It shows a lack of discernment and poor judgement on the part of the commentator to use such a moving target as a “holy disposition” for such an important matter as salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How about “good works, love to God and the brethren” and the rest of the attributes required by the commentaries above? They all fall into the same category of giving the faithful elusive goals that are impossible to achieve. They all require someone’s own subjective assessment of himself to determine whether he is a real or a nominal Christian, whether he’s really zealous for God or only lukewarm. We need something more definitive than this. We need something that is unchangeable, something as firm as the foundation of the world for our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these things put uncertainty into the hearts of believers whether they will have enough oil for the day their Christ comes. But none of these requirements—services and trials, holy disposition, and what not—are mentioned in the parable. The only thing that pits between the wise and the foolish virgins is the oil, the Holy Spirit, and we know from Ephesians 1:13 that the Holy Spirit is given to believers through faith in Christ, not through any works done in the flesh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;watchfulness-revisited&quot;&gt;Watchfulness revisited&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we pay close attention to what we read from the parable, we’d find that the lack of watchfulness on the part of the foolish virgins was at the very beginning when they embarked on the journey without any oil: &lt;em&gt;“&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;The foolish ones took their lamps &lt;u&gt;but &lt;strong&gt;did not&lt;/strong&gt; take any oil with them&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.” They didn’t run out of oil, for if the oil represents the Holy Spirit, it can never run out, it’s eternal like the stream of living water that will never run dry, like the sacrifice of the Lamb of God that paid for our sins once for all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now what about the wise virgins, do they need to be watchful as proposed by most Bible teachers? No, but instead with their being filled with oil, with the Holy Spirit, they could rest in the assurance that they got what they needed to enter the presence of the bridegroom. Jesus gave these parables in Luke 14 which might help us understand what he meant when he said: &lt;em&gt;“Therefore keep watch, because you do not know the day or the hour.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt;“Suppose one of you wants to build a tower. Won’t you first sit down and estimate the cost to see if you have enough money to complete it? &lt;sup&gt;29&lt;/sup&gt;For if you lay the foundation and are not able to finish it, everyone who sees it will ridicule you, &lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt;saying, ‘This person began to build and wasn’t able to finish.’ (Luke 14:28-30)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;“Or suppose a king is about to go to war against another king. Won’t he first sit down and consider whether he is able with ten thousand men to oppose the one coming against him with twenty thousand? &lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt;If he is not able, he will send a delegation while the other is still a long way off and will ask for terms of peace. &lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt;In the same way, those of you who do not give up everything you have cannot be my disciples. (Luke 14:31-33)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we were to put these parables in the language of the commentators above, using their method of subjective evaluation, we can paraphrase these parables as follows: Suppose you want to go to heaven. Won’t you first sit down and estimate the cost to see if you have enough “services and trials,” “holy disposition,” “good works,” “love of God and the brethrens,” “never fall into a slumber nor sleep,” “being always hot and never lukewarm,” “make sure your Christianity is real and and not nominal,” and “be always watchful” to achieve your goal?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can the best person among us without a hint of hypocrisy in his heart answer with a decisive YES? Of course the answer is NO, and yet there are so many Christians who embark on the journey to the promised land without first making sure they have the oil they need, they’re like the foolish virgins who get on the road “hoping” to get a filling along the way. Little did they know the bridegroom may appear to them at any time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many spiritual leaders send their flock on the road without any oil in their lamps like that. Perhaps they don’t even have it themselves so they don’t think it’s necessary. This is where the exhortation for watchfulness becomes an indispensible part of their ministries. But to those who already has oil in their lamps, the bridegroom might as well be already in their hearts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And you also were included in Christ when you heard the message of truth, the gospel of your salvation. When you believed, you were marked in him with &lt;u&gt;a seal, the promised Holy Spirit&lt;/u&gt;. (Ephesians 1:13)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then how can it be that some virgins, some Christians, are so foolish that they embark on their journey with the oil of the Holy Spirit?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;in-conclusion&quot;&gt;In conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The watchfulness theology commits the gross error of assuming the foolish virgins may, through their watchfulness, good works, or repentance and obedience, or their efforts in banishing sins from their lives, may somehow get the oil they need for their lamps. This parable tells us that they cannot  through any means whatsoever get the oil they need AFTER they took their lamps. What this means is no amount of good works, watchfulness, obedience and repentance, can get them what they lacked in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So many Christians commit the same fallacy with the foolish virgins.  They entered the Christian faith, like the virgins took their lamps, but neglected to come to the full understanding of their salvation, like the foolish virgins who did not take the oil along with their lamps. In the parable of the sower Jesus concluded that the key difference between the good and bad soils was the understanding of the gospel they received, or the lack thereof.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another major mistake they made was their asking the wise virgins for the oil they needed. They should have instead realized their mistake and went back to the place where they got their lamps and ask for the oil from the source. What does this mean in the Christian life? This place where the oil can be asked for is the place of grace, the beginning of the journey, being empty handed, and it is there the oil, the Holy Spirit, can be given at just the cost of believing. Trying to find oil when you’re already on the journey is impossible because it can neither be shared nor bought. Perhaps the wise virgins’ advice to the foolish ones to go buy oil is a sarcasm that Jesus used often to those who attempted to get right with God through the works of the law. Ah, there it is: no one can through the works of the law gets a filling of the oil of the Holy Spirit of God (Romans 3:20). Go back. Leave everything behind, your religious achievements, your righteous deeds, your years in ministries, your place in your faith communities, and come back to that place at the foot of the cross again afresh. Get your filling of God’s oil to the brim before you get back on your journey. And while you’re on it, don’t ever doubt that &lt;em&gt;“Christ in you, the hope of glory”&lt;/em&gt; (Colossians 1:27) and commit the deadly fallacy of trying to buy, or work to earn, the oil of God that can only be received for free, because once again, either you had it, the oil, the Spirit of God, at that place of grace, or you don’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question most often asked by Christians is, “What is the will of God for my life?” Many books have been written with the express purpose of showing readers how to get an answer to this question. However most missed the true meaning of the will of God for those who are seeking it for their lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://vacsf.org/assets/images/the-will-of-God-teaser.jpg&quot; style=&quot;border: 1px solid #cccccc; margin: 7px 15px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 148px; padding: 0px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;
God creates man with a heart that longs for meaning, for a sense of purpose, and self-worth, reflecting King David’s assessment of himself: &lt;em&gt;“I praise you because I’m fearfully and wonderfully made (Psalm139:14).”&lt;/em&gt; But sadly their hearts are now empty, and there is nothing in this world that can fill that God-shaped vacuum. However this article is not an apologetic about man’s need for God, but about people who already believe in God yet they’re still lost. Perhaps they’re not lost in relation to their place in God’s kingdom, but to the time between the present and when God calls them home; and they found their lives in Christ anything but abundant. Might this also be the reason why many Christians do not have that blessed assurance of their salvation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;before-i-became-a-christian&quot;&gt;Before I became a Christian&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the experiences expressed here may not apply to those who were born and raised in a Christian environment, but perhaps it may still hold true for most as they will usually develop a genuine faith in Christ much later in life. It is during such time that there is much confusion, many questions unanswered, many concerns about the future, the desperate longing for the meaning of life, a natural need for a sense of belonging, and infinite possibilities of longings that are expressed in different shapes or forms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for me, the reading of Hermann Hesse’ Steppen Wolf during my early college years triggered a torrent of existential questions that served as an outlet from an attempt to find answers for these nagging questions. The author’s thoughts served as stimuli for my own thoughts as I tried to navigate my inner landscape. The multitude of thoughts though were very entertaining at first, gradually became unbearable as they circled endlessly without coming to any meaningful conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;after-i-became-a-christian&quot;&gt;After I became a Christian&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After more than a decade of trying to think my way out of the maze of life through existential thoughts, and dabbling in Trancendental Meditation and a study of the Bhagavad Gita through a commentary by a Hindu guru and various other literature, God opened my eyes to the wonderful gospel of Jesus Christ. An image I like to use to describe this life changing event is I saw Christ’s invitation for me as a perfect jump off point out of the vicious cycle, the treadmill, of self help salvation that promised but did not deliver. I felt a wonderful sense of a lightness of being as never before; a great burden fell off my back; a peaceful feeling of my feet being firmly planted on the ground, I could settle down and start building a life as any normal human being would. It was such a wonderful feeling of being at peace with the world, not having to try to escape anymore as I used to in my recurring dreams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the initial joy of salvation proved to be short lived. The quest for life’s meaning is now translated into the pursuit of the will of God. The difference is now God is in the picture. I used to be accountable to myself but now it’s God I will have to answer to. Though the scope of the pursuit for meaning is much smaller, it’s still large enough to cause any Christian great consternation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It didn’t take long before I got back on the treadmill of performance. My recurring nightmares of being lost somewhere, or losing something precious, or falling so far behind in my classwork that there was no way to catch up, are now replaced with dreams of being a missionary in some remote corner of the world. Though they were not nightmares, they were unfulfilled dreams nonetheless. The volume of Christian literature kept me busy for several years but there were still many questions unanswered. What is God’s will for my life? How can I serve Him? Trips to downtown neighborhood telling folks of the great news of Jesus Christ provided some meaning and satisfaction for but a short while; many times during those trips I wondered if I really knew what I was telling folks, about Jesus’ promises of burden lifted and rest for the weary souls. I was like a salesman who was trying to sell folks a product he’s never fully benefitted from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;some-bible-references-on-gods-will&quot;&gt;Some Bible references on God’s will&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s consider some frequently quoted Bible references that appear to tell us what the will of God is for believers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;For this is the will of God, your sanctification: that you abstain from sexual immorality; &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;that each one of you know how to control his own body in holiness and honor, &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;not in the passion of lust like the Gentiles who do not know God. (1 Thess 4:3-5)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Give thanks in all circumstances; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you. (1 Thess 5:18)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From these references we read that the will of God for us are at least avoiding sexual temptations and being always filled with gratitude. How about God’s will for us concerning tithing, fruit of the Spirit, evangelism, godly characters, Bible study, relationship, greed, jealousy, pride, wisdom, anger, hypocrisy, honesty, and an almost an unlimited number of other good things? Though the number of verses in the Bible shows only a handful of the wills of God, in reality there are as many as man’s imagination can conjure up as they’re reflected in Christian literature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With an infinite possibilities of the wills of God for one’s life, the Christian is kept quite busy trying to figure out what or how many wills God has for them. The question that might be raised at this point is when can they experience Jesus’ promise of rest for them, or when can they claim for themselves the “It’s finished” that Jesus uttered before He took his last breath?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-problem-of-sin&quot;&gt;The problem of sin&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually people think of sin as something that is obviously sinful such as adultery, murder, or whatever else that their faith tells them, but in reality everything that gives a person a sense of failure becomes a sin to him. God gives us the story of Job to demonstrate to us the power of a person’s mind in condemning him in the situation of a failure. In Job’s case it was his big loss of everything he possessed. We saw that Job’s friends deduced that it must have been Job’s sins that brought him to such state. Even Job himself thought he had sinned and tried to defend his righteousness. The story of the man blind since birth was also a case in point where people concluded that his failure, his blindness, is a consequence of his own or his parents’ sins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chances for setbacks are ever present in human existence, which means the Christians are always living with a guilty conscience especially in relation to the will of God and how they deal with them in their lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If anyone, then, knows the good they ought to do and doesn’t do it, it is sin for them. (James 4:17)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This applies to preachers and pew sitters alike with probably more guilt on the preachers because they tend to tell others to do things they don’t do themselves (Luke 11:46). But no matter who you are, this mode of living being under a perpetual affect of sin and its associated guilt is a direct antithesis of the gospel of good news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-covenants&quot;&gt;The Covenants&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following Deuteronomy 28:1-2 passage is representative of the Old Covenant based relationship between God and man which can be summarized as saying “if you do this then I will do that.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If you fully obey the LORD your God and carefully follow all his commands I give you today, the LORD your God will set you high above all the nations on earth. All these blessings will come on you and accompany you if you obey the LORD your God (Deuteronomy 28:1-2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The promise of blessings is conditional upon full obedience to the LORD your God, therefore it shouldn’t come as a surprise to us why people think the way they do in the story of Job and the man born blind, and we see it being played out regularly in church settings through testimonies and conversations, which basically means the lack of blessings must be a sign you’re not right with God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we all know that God cannot be wrong, and so is His commandments, or His law. That leaves the possibility that we are very likely wrong about our understanding the role and purpose of the law. It’s not given to man as a golden rule to live by, but as an instrument to point out man’s utter depravity and their need for Christ. The misconception of the law as a golden rule causes man to be stuck on the treadmill of performance, or of perpetually seeking God’s will without ever getting to a place where they can find rest for their souls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-true-will-of-god&quot;&gt;The true WILL of God&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far we’ve seen that there is a fundamental, an innate desire in man to find life’s meaning and purpose. For those who do not or have not yet entered a relationship with God through His Son, he’s driven by a law rooted in their conscience which dictates their every thought and action. For those who call themselves Christians, they’re driven by what is written in the Bible; for them though the written Scriptures is more concrete and more realizable than the conscience based one, it is still vague enough to those who follow it to wander endlessly in the desert of seeking the will of God without ever reaching the promised land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is however a different kind of will of God, not the kind commonly understood and taught in the Christian world, not one to strive for, but one which Christ died to guarantee our ownership, not the one based on our ability, but the one inherited by faith. Hebrews 9 refers to this will of God as an eternal inheritance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;For this reason Christ is the mediator of a new covenant, that those who are called may receive the promised eternal inheritance—now that he has died as a ransom to set them free from the sins committed under the first covenant.  &lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;In the case of a will, it is necessary to prove the death of the one who made it,   &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;because a will is in force only when somebody has died; it never takes effect while the one who made it is living. (Hebrews 9:15-17)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To realize this eternal inheritance, the follower of Christ must stop all their vain pursuits to find God’s will in the traditional, but worldly, sense, and rest at the foot of the cross of Christ so their eyes might be opened to see the will, or rather the inheritance, that is already theirs in Christ, that it’s not outside of them to seek, but that it’s already theirs by God’s promise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is truly what it means to be transformed by the renewing of your mind. To no longer follow Christ according to the pattern of the world, which is to look from within ourselves the resources for meanings, or for means to satisfy a perceived will of God, but to look to Christ alone for what that is already ours, enough for us to enter the kingdom of heaven, to be fully accepted by God, to be already fully sanctified for God’s purpose, and many other wonderful gifts that God gives us along with Christ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-inheritance&quot;&gt;The inheritance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Old Covenant concept of inheritance, the land, is a foreshadowing of the New Covenant’s inheritance we have in Christ (see footnotes). We found this in the book of Numbers where land was distributed such that each family receives a plot of land sufficient to support itself and subsequently transfered to the next generation through inheritance:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;52&lt;/sup&gt;The Lord spoke to Moses, saying: &lt;sup&gt;53&lt;/sup&gt;To these the land shall be apportioned for inheritance according to the number of names. &lt;sup&gt;54&lt;/sup&gt;To a large tribe you shall give a large inheritance, and to a small tribe you shall give a small inheritance; every tribe shall be given its inheritance according to its enrollment. &lt;sup&gt;55&lt;/sup&gt;But the land shall be apportioned by lot; according to the names of their ancestral tribes they shall inherit. &lt;sup&gt;56&lt;/sup&gt;Their inheritance shall be apportioned according to lot between the larger and the smaller. (Numbers 26:52-56)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But inevitably there will be a loss of ownership due to adverse circumstances, through failed farming, sickness, or other forms of failure. Except in rare circumstances, most of those who end up losing their possessions due to hardship never recover enough to buy them back. The Lord ordained the year of jubilee, one in every fifty (Leviticus 25:8-17), including the sabbath year, one in every seven (Leviticus 25:1-7), to sanctify Isarael’s economy. In the sabbath year, each field must not be cultivated or harvested from, but the law concerning the jubilee year had much more implications: all lands leased or sold to others for whatever reasons must be returned to their original owners, and all slaves and bonded laborers were to be freed (Leviticus 25:10).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effect of the jubilee year was to prevent any family to become permanently landless through sale, mortgage, or permanent lease of its assigned land. This provides a means for the destitude to raise money for survival until the next jubilee year. But we must know that, whatever God does, He does it as part of His great plan of salvation to restore back to man what that was lost at the Fall. The jubilee year was the foreshadowing of God’s grace when people who lost their eternal life can be restored without having to meet any payment (Leviticus 25:10-17).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is to fulfill God’s promise to Abraham that they would have water from the cisterns they did not dig and eat from vineyards and olive groves they did not plant (Deut 6:11). The returning of the lost inheritance in the year of jubilee is a wonderful foreshadowing of the returning of the Holy Spirit to the believers, and it is consistent as always with how God saves us: &lt;em&gt;“&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;For by grace you are saved through faith, and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God;  &lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;it is not from works, so that no one can boast.” (Ephesians 2:8-9)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us survey the following parts of our spiritual inheritance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bull-the-indwelling-holy-spirit&quot;&gt;• The indwelling Holy Spirit&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;In him we were also chosen,[a] having been predestined according to the plan of him who works out everything in conformity with the purpose of his will, &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;in order that we, who were the first to put our hope in Christ, might be for the praise of his glory. &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;And you also were included in Christ when you heard the message of truth, the gospel of your salvation. When you believed, you were marked in him with &lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a seal, the promised Holy Spirit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;, &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;who is a deposit guaranteeing our inheritance until the redemption of those who are God’s possession—to the praise of his glory. (Ephesians 1:11-14)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;What we have received is not the spirit of the world, but &lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the Spirit who is from God&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;, so that we may understand what God has freely given us. (1 Corinthians 2:12)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Do you not know that your bodies are &lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;temples of the Holy Spirit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;, who is in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own;” (1 Corinthians 6:19)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bull-redemption-and-forgiveness-of-sin&quot;&gt;• Redemption and Forgiveness of sin&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“In whom we have redemption in his blood, the forgiveness of sins.” (Colossians 1:14)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, in accordance with the riches of God’s grace” (Ephesians 1:7)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for ours but also for the sins of the whole world.” (1 John 2:2)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bull-sanctified-and-justified&quot;&gt;• Sanctified and Justified&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God. (1 Corinthians 6:11)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bull-assurance-of-salvation&quot;&gt;• Assurance of salvation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“My dear children, I write this to you so that you will not sin. But if anybody does sin, we have an advocate with the Father—Jesus Christ, the Righteous One.” (1 John 2:1)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even the best lawyer in the world cannot defend us like this wonderful heavenly Advocate the Son of the living God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bull-and-everything-we-need&quot;&gt;• And everything we need&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;He who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all–how will he not also, along with him, graciously give us all things? (Romans 8:32)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;in-conclusion&quot;&gt;In conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully at this point it has become clear concerning the differences between the two viewpoints of the will of God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the traditional and most common view, the will of God is something that is up to the believer to discover what it is for themselves, whether they will be happy, or productive, or in line with God’s will for their lives. If they struggle in their earthly living or their walk with God, it’s probably because they don’t pray hard enough, they don’t spend enough time at revival conferences, they don’t participate enough in church activities, or other things that they failed to do. If they miss the will of God, it’s their own fault.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the will of God as inheritance for the believer cannot be lost. It is theirs whether they know it or nor, whether they have the ability to hang on to it or not. It’s purchased for them by the blood of the Lamb of God. It might sound like a cop out but that’s the way God wants it, as He has ordained it in the law of jubilee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pursuit of the will of God after the pattern of the world leaves the believer never fulfilled, it always leaves them in the state of uncertainty because he will never know what God’s will is for his life, and even when he thinks he does know the will of God, it’s never enough. It draws their eyes inward toward self as virtually all they’re seeking are to meet the needs of their flesh. No matter how well they’re dressed in spiritual trappings, it’s still the efforts of the flesh, and they will inevitably produce fleshly results, and they’re centered on self instead of Christ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conversely the will of God as an inheritance requires all fleshly efforts to cease. The believer now takes their eyes off of themselves and set them on Christ in whom are all they need for godliness and contentment. They can rest because no one can take away their promised inheritance because the jubilee year has come. This is the true will of God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a life is driven by any purpose, let that purpose be to rest in what Christ had accomplished just as it is written in Hebrews 4:11: &lt;em&gt;“Let us, therefore, make every effort to enter that rest.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://vacsf.org/assets/images/Obedience-teaser.jpg&quot; style=&quot;border: 1px solid #cccccc; margin: 7px 15px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 148px; padding: 0px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;
There are more than a few dozens of verses in the Bible that contain the word obedience or other forms of it, but none are as well remembered as the refrain of the hymn Trust and Obey. This article aims to show that there are two ways the term is interpreted and applied, one is of the obedience to avoid sins, or to do what is good—this is the most common, and is the type that I call “rudimentary obedience”—, and one of a response to the gospel to enter into a trust relationship with God through Christ—this is rarely taught as an act of obedience as compared to the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;obedience-and-the-law&quot;&gt;Obedience and the law&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though there are many things we should be obedient about, it appears obedience in relation to sins seems to be something people are most concerned with; either by commission or omission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much energy is spent trying to get the flesh under control, to avoid sins as much as possible. But how successful are these efforts through the ages? Are Christians sinning less and less? The amount of material still dedicated to flesh control shows if it isn’t a losing battle, it hasn’t made any progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also obedience cannot exist apart from a certain system of law. The person following certain patterns of obedience must be under some law. It draws a line between obedience and disobedience, it defines what meets a certain criteria and what doesn’t. To a Christian who did not come into the faith from a Jewish system of laws, he may be under a conscience based law (Romans 2:14) that can exacerbate the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This mode of living runs decidedly against what is taught in the Bible that we’re no longer under law but under grace (Romans 6:14), and we have died to the law since Christ died for us (Romans 7:4). Romans 7:6 says it more emphatically that &lt;em&gt;“we have been released from the law”&lt;/em&gt;. And if we follow the thread of reasoning in Romans all the way to Romans 8:12, we’d find that those who measure their standing with God through the law/obedience are actually living according to the flesh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following verse may explain why the law fails in restraining the flesh:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For when we were in the flesh, the &lt;strong&gt;sinful desires, aroused by the law&lt;/strong&gt;, were active in the members of our body to bear fruit for death. (Romans 7:5)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a time when obedience/law was required to lead us to Christ. The Bible describes us during this time as little children whose guardian, or schoolmaster, is the law who we must obey until we come to Christ. The problem as we have seen is the overwhelming majority of Christians still insists on living under the law, or the obedience to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-obedience-which-is-faith&quot;&gt;The Obedience which is Faith&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However there is a much better obedience, one that is not powered by the law, but by grace through faith. It doesn’t require useless efforts of the flesh, but it requires rest. A rest freely given to those who comes to Christ to trust in His proclamation: &lt;em&gt;“It’s finished!”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Calvinists and Armenians believe that the only people who can make it to the kingdom of God are those who persevere, or be obedient, all the way to the end of their lives. Their obedience is based on compliance to the law. Not the obedience proposed by this article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article proposes that the very faith in the finished work of Christ is itself the obedience that Christ came to die for. This obedience is expressed in the following two verses:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;. . . through whom we have received grace and apostleship for &lt;strong&gt;obedience to the faith&lt;/strong&gt; among all nations for His name. (Romans 1:5 —NKJV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;. . . and by the prophetic Scriptures [the mystery] has been made known to all nations, according to the commandment of the everlasting God, for &lt;strong&gt;obedience to the faith&lt;/strong&gt;. (Romans 16:26 — NKJV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s also consider these verses that help us see that to obey God is to believe in the one He’s sent: Acts 6:7, Romans 10:16, 2 Thessalonians 1:8, John 3:36, John 6:28-29, 1 Peter 1:2, 1 Peter 1:22, 1 Peter 2:7-8, and Acts 5:32 (please go &lt;a href=&quot;https://faithalone.org/magazine/y1993/93july3.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for a great explanation of the &lt;em&gt;“obedience which is faith”&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who do you believe, the Calvinists/Armenians or the Bible? John 3:16 puts it very simply, and powerfully, directly from the mouth of God: &lt;em&gt;“For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that &lt;strong&gt;whosoever&lt;/strong&gt; believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life (KJV).”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the obedience that pleases God. This is the obedience that works. And this alone is the obedience that takes you to heaven. The other obedience may actually make you fall from grace because all will have failed it all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it. &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life, and only a few find it (Matthew 7:13-14).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

According to most common interpretations, the narrow gate, or path, denotes troubles and challenges awaiting those who choose to embark on it. However there is curiously a paradoxical expectation that the life of a good Christian is filled with God’s blessings, especially material blessings, great financial rewards and a vibrant family life; a projection of God’s goodness to those who belong to Him as a testimony to the unbelieving world. But there is nothing in the immediate context of these verses that warrants such interpretations, of promises of either difficulties or smooth sailings. Yet this is what one often hears from pulpits everywhere across the entire spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;common-interpretationscontradictions&quot;&gt;Common interpretations/contradictions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sufferings&quot;&gt;Sufferings&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In accordance with common interpretations, one is warned of a hard life that is expected of those who follow Christ. We were warned of persecutions from the enemies of the cross, we were advised to be ready to make many sacrifices, to forsake any thoughts of a comfortable life, or of privileges. And if &lt;em&gt;“the Son of Man has no place to lay his head (Luke 9:58)”&lt;/em&gt; who are we to expect any better? Suffering seems to be the underlying theme in most if not all sermons, and virtually all religions of the world as well. Some price has to be paid, some work has to be performed so there might be gain, and since there cannot be something that comes from nothing, so it is with salvation, there must be some suffering as a prerequisite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;blessings&quot;&gt;Blessings&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly in the same Sunday worship service, folks are encouraged to share their blessings. The more the blessings, the more proofs of their being right with God. Blessings such as successful children, healing of diseases, jobs found, babies born, protection from a near fatal automobile accident, miraculous divine intervention, answered prayers, and myriad accounts that validate one’s good standing with God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-contradictions&quot;&gt;The contradictions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Has something changed? Do sermons actually prepare folks for a hard life ahead, or do they promise folks of an easy life once they enter the faith? Damned if you do and damned if you don’t. Forget about messages you hear of the virtue of suffering, you feel cursed if your life is filled with adversities. Wasn’t this what happened to Job? Or the assumptions people made of the man blind since birth?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside of the Christian circles, people who share common troubles actually find in their support groups the comfort of knowing they’re not alone, yet within the supposedly loving body of Christ, they feel like outcasts. It’s not that they are actually condemned by their fellow believers, but it is because they feel a condemnation within their own souls due to conflicting messages they’ve heard over the years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-kingdom-of-god&quot;&gt;The Kingdom of God&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without a firm and sound foundation of biblical understanding of how God accepts and saves them, the believers base their relationship with God entirely on their circumstances. Instead of rejoicing in their adversities, they engage in morbid introspection to try to figure out what they’ve done wrong, whether they’ve failed God somehow. Instead of treading lightly while receiving God’s blessings with open hands, knowing deep in their hearts that it was due to God’s grace and mercies toward them, they either brag or judge those who are going through difficulties. The book of Job and the story of the man blind since birth are demonstrations of this type of thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is the root of the problem. If salvation, or justification, is based on performance, on works, or on personal merit, so it is with everything else. How we approach the kingdom of God will inevitably color the lenses through which we make our evaluations. Matthew 6:33 says &lt;em&gt;“Seek first the Kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things will be added unto you,”&lt;/em&gt; Yet so much bandwidth is dedicated to &lt;em&gt;“all these things,”&lt;/em&gt; where all these things include supposedly noble endeavors such as ministries, evangelism, prayers, Bible studies, giving to the poor, parenting, overcoming addictions, peer pressure, and tons of other how-tos. But as good as &lt;em&gt;“all these things”&lt;/em&gt; are, they’re not part of the Kingdom of God and His righteousness, they’re still on this side of eternity. As a matter of fact, the Lord had revealed to Isaiah that they’re but &lt;em&gt;“filthy rags.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who can really know the true meaning of the Kingdom of God and His righteousness? The only people who know what the Kingdom of God is like are those who have entered it; the rest are people on the outside speculating about things they do not know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;gods-righteousness&quot;&gt;God’s righteousness&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only people who can enter the Kingdom of God are those who are deemed righteous by God. And yet it’s not their own righteousness, but the righteousness of God that is bestowed on them. And how is it bestowed on them? Not by works, but by faith. Since it’s entirely by God’s grace and mercies upon them that they enjoy this righteousness, they don’t have to wait; God has already called Himself their Father and them His children. Since their heavenly inheritance is not at all dependent on them, but on the finished work of Christ, they have become alive again like when God gave the Holy Spirit to mankind at the beginning of creation. These people are already inside the Kingdom of God. They know what they’re talking about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who are still outside? These are the people who depend on the works of the law to make their faith perfect. What the law does is it reminds them of their sins. It creates a formidable barrier between them and God because:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For no one can ever be made right with God by doing what the law commands. The law simply shows us how sinful we are.
(Romans 3:20 — NLT)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their works are never over. The law instead of giving them the righteousness they need to enter God’s kingdom, it drives them further from God because it magnifies their sins like the giants in the promised land. Therefore by definition those who depend on the works of the law cannot possibly know God or His kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;narrow-vs-broad&quot;&gt;Narrow vs. broad&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God allows no means of access to Him other than His own provision: Jesus Christ. He said this in John 14:6:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world has always tried to access God through their own efforts, through works of various laws, but Jesus shows them a very narrow path: trusting in the finished work of Christ. That’s how narrow it is. It’s not narrow because of troubles or difficulties, but because of how God defines it. For those who depend on their works, the path is broad in the sense that each one is on their own lane, each one defines their own way how to access God, because each person’s work is different from another’s. It’s a broad path with infinite opportunities to get lost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;deadly-misinterpretation&quot;&gt;Deadly misinterpretation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By defining the narrow path as a difficult road, people change its meaning from grace to works, from the singular trust in Christ to the myriad possibilities of man’s efforts, from the assurance of salvation to the uncertainty of random choices to meet arbitrary man-made standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The true narrow path is in fact the easiest one as it is straight and narrow with no deviations or detours, it leads straight from captivities to the promised land. On it, God takes us home on &lt;a href=&quot;http://vacsf.org/articles/Exodus-19-04-25/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;wings of eagles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (Exodus 19:4).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However this narrow path may prove difficult to those who walk by the flesh—keep in mind that it is not about falling into sinful temptations, but about using fleshly efforts to draw near to God—. As this article attempts to show that the difficulties lie not in trying circumstances, but in the choice that one makes. Those who rely on the law, or the works of it, or the obedience of the flesh, have much to lose like the rich young ruler who met Jesus in Matthew 19:16-22. Without works as their trophies they cannot boast from their self righteousness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great accountability lies with the handlers of Scriptures. How have you interpreted biblical concepts such as “the narrow path” to those who sit under your pulpits? Are you helping folks to, or preventing them from, entering the Kingdom of God?&lt;/p&gt;
