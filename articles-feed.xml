    &lt;p&gt;A well known Bible expositor wrote a book, whose title is borrowed for this article, to help believers prepare themselves against the day of Christ’s return. This article proposes a more certain, and Scripture-based, way to be ready for that day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-action-guide&quot;&gt;The action guide&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://vacsf.org/assets/images/7-days-teaser.jpg&quot; style=&quot;border: 1px solid #cccccc; margin: 7px 15px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 148px; padding: 0px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;
The author appeals to Jesus’ command to believers to be servants of others, and to the gifts God gives to each believer according to the parable of the talents, and other positive things they should do in preparing themselves for the day Christ comes again. This article will examine and rebut several faulty assumptions delivered in the sermon that was used as the basis for the action guide. The article is not written as an attack of the expositor or his ministries, but it sees the topic as emblematic of the common teachings that stunt believer’s growth, putting doubts in their relationship with God, and instead proposes a more Scriptural approach to achieve the readiness with certainty. Here’s the introduction to the “7 Days Until Christ Returns - An Action Guide.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What would you do if you knew Jesus would return in seven days? Though the Bible clearly tells us that no man knows the date when Christ will return, it is an interesting and profound exercise to look at how our lives might change if we had the knowledge that Christ would return seven days from now. What would you do? Would your daily routine change? What is standing between you and the Lord that you would want to make right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-dilemma&quot;&gt;The dilemma&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the expositor, though believers are doctrinally saved as they placed their trust in Christ, they must still face his judgement seat to give an answer to how they live while still in the flesh. Another well known expositor also gives this description of the judgement seat of Christ: &lt;em&gt;“Thus, the purpose of the judgment seat of Christ is to examine a Christian’s total life. We will be recompensed for the deeds we have done, whether good or bad (2 Cor. 5:10). The term used there refers to a summing up and estimation of the total pattern of a believer’s life. “&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question that must be asked is: can the totality of a Christian’s relationship with God be compartmentalized into the parts before and after they’re saved, or specifically the unconditional forgiveness of their sins and the conditional rewards, or the lack thereof, that follow? Is there truth in the assertion that the completely grace-based gift of eternal life and the work-based recompense of the deeds while still in the flesh are all summed up to make up the total worth of a believer’s life?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Christian journey through life usually follows a pattern where the grace-based gift of forgiveness of sins and eternal life recedes back to the brief moment in time when the believer expressed his trust in Christ, then yielded to the long stretch of the years ahead filled with question of one’s worth before the Lord: am I good enough for the Christ who is coming back? The assurance of salvation gradually fades away to the point the believer questions whether if it was even real, then subsequently he’s resigned to the possibility that he might not be saved after all. The question whether he’s done enough as he examines his deeds looms large in his mind, and perhaps like most believers he would instinctively pushes it to the back of his mind. The believer might return from the sermon full of zeal and a sense of purpose, maybe for the full 7 days, but those days will soon pass, and if he’s to continue the pattern of zeal any further he will most likely find himself worn out from the superhuman effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now back to the topic from which this article was prompted to be written. The author of &lt;em&gt;“7 Days Until Christ Returns”&lt;/em&gt; proposes two reasons why believers should do their utmost to prepare themselves to meet their Lord: 1) Christ’s call to servanthood, and 2) the talents he’s given to each and everyone. Let’s examine each one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;servanthood&quot;&gt;Servanthood&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The author expounds on the servanthood attitude of believers, which is without doubt a virtue fitting for anyone who calls on the name of Christ. However, let us recall the context of this writing. The author puts us in the hypothetical 7 days before Christ returns which puts us in a more urgent state than normal. With only 7 days left, is servanthood likely among the most urgent thing to take care of? I’d venture not. Servanthood is more like a lifestyle, a pattern of living that characterizes a Christian’s life journey whether he has seven days left or not. It’s a fruit of a life born of the Spirit of God. But why stop at servanthood? There is forgiveness, compassion, humility, a giving heart, making amends, bible study, visiting the sick, and myriad other things high on the list of virtues Christians aspire to develop especially during these short 7 days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can a Christian realistically choose one most important thing he can do during the seven short days to make him more ready to meet his Lord? For the sake of argument, let’s just say we go easy and allow the Christian to pick only one most important thing on his list to accomplish on these seven days, and let’s say it’s servanthood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the possibility that this Christian finds exactly a perfect opportunity to serve someone during this time? What is the likelyhood he will find something that has eluded him all the years before this hypothetical seven days? And lastly, will it make him more ready than he’d ever been? The answer to all these questions is a resounding NO. Christians have been doing this since the time of the book of Acts. They keep looking for something that makes them more on fire for God, something that magically transform their spiritual life. But there is no such thing, as everything ever proposed by someone has been proposed by someone else before, and nothing ever brought them closer to their goal. Servanthood, a nice idea, but as vague and as unmeasurable as any other lofty ideals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-talents&quot;&gt;The talents&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a major problem with using the parable of the talents to prepare Christians to meet God because it is not about &lt;em&gt;“recompense for the deeds done while in the flesh,”&lt;/em&gt; or about rewards or the lack thereof. It’s about salvation, who will be saved and who will not be. The evidence for this is in the last verse of this parable: &lt;em&gt;“As for this worthless slave, throw him into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth (Matthew 25:30).”&lt;/em&gt; God does not call his sanctified saint &lt;em&gt;“worthless slave”&lt;/em&gt; and he will not cast them into outer darkness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, our Lord God is nothing like the slave owner in this parable. He never reaps where he does not sow. And not only does he sow, he sows the amazing seed of the gospel: his only begotten Son.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, when this parable is applied indiscrimately to Christians, it cannot help but put them in the mindset of unsaved people, instead of allowing them to work out their salvation as children of God, it brings them back to the place where they’re still alienated from God and had to work to earn their salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;faulty-application&quot;&gt;Faulty application&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far we’ve seen that the two basic premises of 7-Days put the believers in a wrong place in their attempt to prepare them for the day of Christ’s return. Though the expositor assures listeners that they’re already saved, in his encouraging them to better prepare themselves, he puts doubt in their minds that they may not be saved after all. The parable of the talents, in its being misapplied, is the principle offender.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the doctrinally erroneous applications of the servanthood exhortation and the parable of the talents, the practical implication is also great. How much is enough of my servitude, and to whom? How many talents have I been blessed with and how have I performed? No one knows with any certainty whether his achievements will be accepted by Christ upon his return. It’s all guesswork, and arbitrary. This is no way for the bridesmaids to wait for the arrival of their bridegroom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our faith in God, our hope of salvation, must be infinitely more certain than what is put forth in the &lt;em&gt;“7 Days Until Christ Returns.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. (Hebrews 11:1)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;false-premise&quot;&gt;False premise&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can a Christian live the rest of his life as if each day is one of the last seven days before Christ returns?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sermon, or the book, might be able to spur the believers to actions for maybe all the seven days, but the self imposed sense of urgency cannot realistically last for any long stretch of time or burnout will set in, and the brief experiment will prove itself to be another failed attempt in moving one on a higher spiritual plane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-once-for-all-perfection&quot;&gt;The once for all perfection&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For by a single offering he has &lt;strong&gt;perfected for all time&lt;/strong&gt; those who are sanctified (Hebrews 10:14).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is how we should prepare ourselves for the day of Christ’s return: to put our hope on what Christ had achieved for us instead of what we can produce with our flesh. If God has made us perfect in Christ, what is it that we’re lacking that causes him to withhold rewards from us? Are you relying on your own sacrifices and offerings or on the &lt;em&gt;“single offering”&lt;/em&gt; prepared by God himself which alone can make you &lt;em&gt;“perfect for all time?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fix your eyes upon Jesus (Hebrews 12:2), my friends. That’s how you prepare for 1 Day, for 7 Days, or even for the rest of your life as you await Christ’ return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;He who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all–how will he not also, along with him, graciously give us all things?  (Romans 8:32)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if God graciously gives you all things along with his Son, will he be stingy about little things that you flesh can produce? Actually you should be glad that he’s not giving you rewards for what that comes from your flesh, because if he does, you may not like it. The rewards are actually threats that if you walk according to the letter of the law, its fruit will you reap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You who are trying to be justified by the law have been alienated from Christ; you have fallen away from grace (Galatians_5:4)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;recompense&quot;&gt;Recompense&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before reaching the conclusion of this article, let us recall the quote of the well known author who refered to 2 Corinthians 5:10 to use in the same vein of thought as the author who erroneously quotes the parable of the talent to keep Christians on their toes as they wait for their Lord’s return. In the same manner as the misapplication of the parable of the talent, the Corinthians verse was also grossly misapplied to the detriment of anyone who subscribes to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the context of 2 Corinthians 5:10 is used, we’d find that the recompense is not meant for Christians as rewards and punishments for actions they perform while in the flesh, but only as the outcome of one of the two choices one makes concerning Christ. The verse that follows helps explain why this is the case:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Therefore, because we know the fear of the Lord, we try to persuade people (2 Corinthians 5:11)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul was talking about a recompense before the judgement seat of Christ where the choice to believe in him leads to life while the choice of not believing leads to death. Therefore, in verse 11, Paul was conveying a message of reconciliation to his audience. He was not at all talking about rewards or the lack there of. The author of 7 Days, though tried to assure his audience that their salvation is secure, by presenting the parable of the talents or 2 Corinthians 5:10 in this manner, puts them in the same footing with unbelievers where the deprivation of reward is equally alarming as the danger of being alienated from God. This explains why those who subscribe to this belief system do not have any assurance of their salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;in-conclusion&quot;&gt;In conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Christians do not live a life of working toward rewards, but of waiting for the day they receive their &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;inheritance&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Rewards are unknown until they are given to their recipients, but an inheritance is known, though sealed as a promise, or a guarantee, and to be received in full just as we read in Romans 8:32.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What rewards can match the wonderful parts of our inheritance in Christ? Consider these: the indwelling Holy Spirit as a deposit guaranteeing our inheritance (Ephesians 1:11-14), the forgiveness of sins (Colossians 1:14), our sanctification and justification (1 Corinthians 6:11), Christ as our advocate (1 John 2:1), and every wonderful things included in Christ (Romans 8:32).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, exhortations such as 7-Days makes a normal Christian life abnormal, it replaces contentment with dissatisfaction, it takes away thanksgiving for what God has given and replace it with yearning for what seems to be greater blessings enjoyed by others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the parable of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://vacsf.org/articles/Parable-Ten-Virgins/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ten Virgins&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, all ten virgins, both the wise and the foolish, fell asleep while waiting for the bridegroom who was a long time in coming. There was no indication of any difference in lifestyle, activities, or performance, between the wise and the foolish virgins, except one thing: the oil the virgins should take with them before they embark on their journey. That was the only thing that counts. That was how they should prepare to meet their Lord, for neither servanthood nor talents would get them the oil they needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;notes&quot;&gt;Notes&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Few Christians know that there is an old covenant and there is a new one, but even fewer really know why there are two, and know enough of their differences to experience a transformation by the renewing of their mind, a paradigm shift in how they relate to their God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;stuck-in-the-old-way&quot;&gt;Stuck in the old way&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://vacsf.org/assets/images/old-vs-new.jpg&quot; style=&quot;border: 1px solid #cccccc; margin: 7px 15px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 148px; padding: 0px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;
Most Christians relate to God in the same way the people of Israel did under the Old Covenant. While the Israelites offered bulls and goats or other sacrifices for their sins, the Christians offer apologies, acts of penance, myriad forms of pious deeds, in their place. Little did they know, or rather if they read the Bible and understand it they should already know, that these acts are completely worthless toward their attempt to draw near to God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href=&quot;http://vacsf.org/parable/The-Net&quot;&gt;Parable of the Net&lt;/a&gt;, Jesus spoke of the a house owner who brought out new and old things from his treasure. Though Jesus did not elaborate on what the owner was going to do with them, we can safely deduce from the first two examples in this parable in which bad fish were discarded and wicked people were thrown into the fiery furnace, that the house owner would discard the old and keep the new. The theme of the abolishing of the old while ushering in the new is continued in force in the Hebrews passage we’re studying here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;hebrews-101-20&quot;&gt;Hebrews 10:1-20&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For the law possesses a shadow of the good things to come but not the reality itself, and is therefore &lt;u&gt;completely unable&lt;/u&gt;, by the same sacrifices offered continually, year after year, &lt;u&gt;to perfect&lt;/u&gt; those who come to worship. (Hebrews 10:1)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sacrifices, the apologies, the acknowledgement of guilt, the self denial, the harsh treatment of self (Colossians 2:23), cannot make them more acceptable to God. Yet God does require perfection of those who want to bathe themselves in his glory (Matthew 5:48).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let read on to the Hebrews verse that follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For otherwise would they not have &lt;u&gt;ceased to be offered&lt;/u&gt;, since the worshipers would have been purified once for all and so have &lt;u&gt;no further consciousness of sin?&lt;/u&gt; (Hebrews 10:2)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the Hebrews verse above, were the pious things you do to get right with God effective at all, they should have &lt;em&gt;“ceased to be offered.”&lt;/em&gt; No more sacrifices, no more acts of penance, no more sin confessions, for if you have been &lt;em&gt;“purified once for all”&lt;/em&gt; and have &lt;em&gt;“no further consciousness of sin,”&lt;/em&gt; why should there till be any need for those acts? But for some inexplicable reason, the Christians still perform these acts in various forms. It must be because they don’t feel they’re good enough for God. There are more sins to be forgiven, more sanctification to strive for, more of something they have a vague inkling of in their mind that they need to arrive at before they can be fully acceptable to God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Hebrews writer goes on to show why the Christians are stuck in this vicious cycle of sinning and confession, of transgressions and repentance or making amends. The following verse shows us why:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But in those sacrifices there is a reminder of sins year after year.  For the blood of bulls and goats cannot take away sins. (Hebrews 10:3-4)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The blood of bulls and goats, the acts of contrition, the making of amends, not only cannot take away sins, they remind the worshippers of what that stand between them and God: their sins. That’s the reason why so many Christians live in a state of perpetual guilt and a sense of inadequacy toward God, because as long as they still have &lt;em&gt;“consciousness of sin,”&lt;/em&gt; they cannot draw near to God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope by now the reader is resolved in his mind that many things commonly practiced and adhered to by most Christians and taught by virtually all preachers for thousands of years have been leading them in a vicious cycle, much like the journey of the Israelites in the desert. The Ten Commandments given them from mount Sinai did exactly that: they remind them of their sins instead of removing them. They didn’t realize that the commandments are not their path to redemption, but formidable barriers that no sinner can cross.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Hebrews passage that follows is nothing short of revolutionary, it demolishes all popular ideas of worship and devotion, and it was foreshadowed in the Old Testament (Psalms 40:6-8):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;So when he came into the world, he said,&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“Sacrifice and offering you did not desire, but a body you prepared for me.  “Whole burnt offerings and sin-offerings you took no delight in. “Then I said, ‘Here I am: I have come - it is written of me in the scroll of the book - to do your will, O God.’”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;When he says above, “Sacrifices and offerings and whole burnt offerings and sin-offerings you did not desire nor did you take delight in them” (which are offered according to the law), then he says, “Here I am: I have come to do your will.” He does away with the first to establish the second.  By his will we have been made holy through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all. (Hebrews 10:5-10)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The very things people think will pave their way to God’s throne, such as their sacrifices and acts of worship and devotion, are neither desired nor taken delight by God. Yet the world is saturated with messages and how-to’s of countless ways to access God’s throne.  But as stated earlier in prior Hebrews’ verses, these things actually led people in circles of frustration, trapping them in the desert of false humility and spirituality. They serve as &lt;em&gt;“a reminder of sins”&lt;/em&gt; (Hebrews 10:3-4) instead of blotting them out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Jesus came to give people a new way to relate to Him, a way that can truly make them holy once for all. And when he establishes this new way for people to relate to him, he abolishes the old way, the way of sacrifices and offerings, be they sacrifice of praise modeled after the sentiment of King David. What is included in this new way, the only and exclusive way that is according to the will of God: the offering of the body of Jesus Christ. This new and living way supersedes all the ways people have used in ages past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Therefore, brothers and sisters, since we have confidence to enter the sanctuary by the blood of Jesus,  by the fresh and living way that he inaugurated for us through the curtain, that is, through his flesh (Hebrews 10:19-20)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has been an exposition on Hebrews 10:1-20, which was inspired by the following quote of Augustin. The reader would do well to understand the contrast between the new and the old covenants referenced in this quote:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;augustine-on-old-vs-new&quot;&gt;Augustine on Old vs New&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;‘I beg of you, however, carefully to observe, as far as you can, what I am endeavouring to prove with so much effort.  When the prophet promised a new covenant, &lt;strong&gt;not according to the covenant which had been formerly made with the people of Israel&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;when liberated from Egypt&lt;/strong&gt;, he said nothing about a change in the sacrifices or any sacred ordinances, although such change, too, was without doubt to follow, as we see in fact that it did follow, even as the same prophetic scripture testifies in many other passages; &lt;strong&gt;but he simply called attention to THIS difference, NAMELY, that God would impress His laws on the MIND of those who belonged to this (New) covenant, and would write them in their HEARTS&lt;/strong&gt;, (Jer 31:32-33) whence the apostle drew his conclusion&lt;strong&gt;,—“not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart;”&lt;/strong&gt; (2 Cor 3:3).  &lt;strong&gt;It is therefore apparent what difference there is between the old covenant and the new&lt;/strong&gt;,—that in the former the law is written on tables, while in the latter on hearts; &lt;strong&gt;so that what in the one alarms from without, in the other delights from within;&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;in the former, man becomes a transgressor through the letter that kills, in the other, a lover through the life-giving spirit.’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The title of a popular Christian song that expresses the desire for change in a believer’s heart. This crying out from deep within of large majority of believers is emblematic of their understanding of the gospel. How do they expect their hearts to be changed? This article will show where the real issues are and a real and realizable answer to a yearning that may not need to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-initial-joy-of-salvation&quot;&gt;The initial joy of salvation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://vacsf.org/assets/images/Change-my-heart-oh-God-teaser.jpg&quot; style=&quot;border: 1px solid #cccccc; margin: 7px 15px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 148px; padding: 0px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;
Though I didn’t walk down the aisle to answer the call to place my trust in Christ in the manner commonly observed at evangelistic events, there were tears streaming down my face, there was a lightness of being as I felt my soul being cleansed from the burden of sin, there was a profound sense of being loved by a power external to my heart that caused me to tremble in a strange but wonderful gladness, and a waterfall of joy that flooded my being. But this is by no means more special or valid than the experiences of others that may be more subtle, and perhaps more from the mind than the heart.  I believe God gives each person an entrance into his kingdom in as unique a way as the individuality that he skillfully crafted into them. Yet for those whose conversion to Christianity is less than spectacular, they yearn for the glorious experiences just the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But no matter how glorious the initial joy of salvation might have been, it’s not meant to last forever. Most testimonies only record the mountain top moments, and though they’re far and few in between what commonly experienced by the large majority of Christians, they’re often cited as the standard against which we must measure our faith. Shortly after the glorious moment of conversion, the Christian begins to wonder if their heart might have grown cold, if they might have failed God, that there might be something more that they missed, and there’s more to be done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-heart-is-not-right&quot;&gt;My heart is not right&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So they cry out: &lt;em&gt;“Change my heart oh God.”&lt;/em&gt; The lyric and the melody of the song soothes the soul of the worshipers. It quenches their thirst for the living water they once tasted when they came to their Savior on bended knees and with teary eyes. It provides a moment of tranquility, of respite from the burdens that life brings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But these wonderful benefits vanish as soon as the last musical note ended. The state of the heart remains the same. Unchanged. At least by the believer’s own estimation. There would still be the same craving for something more, the same feeling that there is something incomplete. This sense of incompleteness may result in the inkling that their heart  is not right with God, that they’re not fully accepted by Him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The believer is not quite sure what is missing. Should he spend more time on his knees praying? More Bible study? More church related activities? But he’s done all that already. He’s faithfully attending church, revival camps, he teaches Sunday School, visit the sick. He’s always available when the body of Christ needs him, for church renovation, for whatever his multitude of talents is needed to minister to others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Occasional visits from missionaries or some sort of God workers stirred in his heart a longing to do something more; perhaps he could join them in their next endeavor, or at least he could participate in setting aside a part of his day to pray toward it. Maybe he can assist them financially.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So he keeps singing Change My Heart Oh God as it perfectly expresses how he feels about his relationship with God. But does this believer know how his heart should be changed? All he knows is he still feels a vacuum in his heart but has no idea how it can be filled. No matter how busy he keeps himself doing the Lord’s work, the emptiness seems only to grow larger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;is-my-heart-meant-to-be-right-with-god&quot;&gt;Is my heart meant to be right with God?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems the believer is falling right back into work-based religion. When he first came to God, he came with empty hands, yet he felt an unspeakable joy. God’s grace was a concept he could grasp as he knew without any doubt the sonship of God he had was truly an undeserved favor, now he’s trying so hard to prove that he’s worthy of the sacrifice of the Son of  God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, this believer got it all wrong. He, or his heart, has never been, and will never be right with God, for to be right with Him he must be perfect, sinless, as pure as Adam and Eve before the Fall. When he knelt before the cross the first time, he acknowledged he could not meet God’s righteous requirement, he relinquished his judgement of right and wrong which Adam and Eve acquired for him as they ate of the forbidden fruit. He was resigned to the fact that the only One who could please God was Christ, and he gladly accepted what Christ did on the cross was a gift that he could freely receive. Why is it that now he feels it isn’t enough? What else must he do to make up for what Christ missed, if indeed the Lord missed something in his work of reconciling him to the Father?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This writing will not show you how to get right with God, it will not show you how to change your heart, or have a changed heart, but it will show you how to love the man, or the woman, that God has already loved and accepted so completely through His Son.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;everything-you-need&quot;&gt;Everything you need&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;He who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all, how will he not also, along with him, graciously give us all things? (Romans 8:32)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All things means exactly that: ALL things. All things you need for godliness and contentment. All things you need to be more than conquerors in Christ Jesus (Romans 8:37). All things you need to boldly enter God’s throne of grace (Hebrews 10:20). All things to make you fully acceptable to God. Not at some point in the future, not something you get incrementally, but right now, and fully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There is NOW no longer any condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus (Romans 8:1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So are you in Christ? If you are, your soul can rest, your work is done, the work of believing in the One God has sent (John 6:29).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If God has fully accepted you, he must have also fully accepted your heart. But the peculiar thing is week in, week out, this heart still cries out to God to be changed. How can it be that a child of God who is so loved and accepted by God still find it difficult to love and accept himself? Were it the Lord’s will to change the believer’s heart, wouldn’t he be the best one to know when and how to get it done? The Lord is the molder and his subject is but clay in his hand. If he’s pleased of the state of his creation, who are we to question his work, or to hurry his hand?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;… Now he has reconciled you by his physical body through death to present you holy, without blemish, and blameless before him -  if indeed you remain in the faith, established and firm, without shifting from the hope of the gospel that you heard (Colossians 1:22-23).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you want any more than what God has stated that it’s finished? As a matter of fact this was what Jesus uttered on the cross before he took his last breath. He declared that the work to present you as &lt;em&gt;“holy, without blemish, and blameless before God”&lt;/em&gt; was done. Therefore Jesus is now resting at the right hand of the Father as a testament to the re-creation he has done in the lives of those who put their trust in him. He resurrected fallen Man and he declared that it was good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;just-as-i-am&quot;&gt;Just as I am&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Just as I am, thou wilt receive,
wilt welcome, pardon, cleanse, relieve;
because thy promise I believe,
O Lamb of God, I come, I come (Hymn Just as I Am, Without One Plea)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as you were when you first knelt before your Redeemer, so are you now as you walk with Him the rest of your days. Your heart, whatever the state that it may be in, might it be filled with the joy of salvation, or weary and falling into a state of drowsiness like the virgins in Jesus’ parable, might it be calm as it perceives that everything makes sense, or in great anxiety as everything seems to be going wrong, God’s love for that heart will never change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To you who sings Change My Heart Oh God without seeing its incompatibility with your new identity in Christ, perhaps you’re basing the assurance of your salvation upon a shaky foundation. You’re basing it upon yourself, your state of mind, or heart, your ability, or whatever else that comes from your very self. No, you should not do that, but instead you should base it on Christ and what he accomplished on the cross.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The song reflects a believer who is obsessed with himself, one who engages in morbid introspection. But we are admonished by not just the Hebrews writer (Hebrews 12:2), but by Jesus himself that we should fix our eyes on him, as he says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the wilderness, so the Son of Man must be lifted up, that everyone who believes in Him may have eternal life (John 3:14-15).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you keep trying to change your heart, or asking God to change it for that matter, chances are good that you won’t experience any changes at all, but if you fix your eyes on Jesus, you might find that even you can accept your own heart, as God has accepted it so, and changes might come swiftly when you least expect it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, your heart has already been changed though you may not feel it, and others may not see it, but its right standing before God has been signed and sealed by the very promise of God long ago:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come: The old has gone, the new is here! (2 Corinthians 5:17—NIV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Live by faith, o God’s righteous ones, for the just shall live by faith (Romans 1:17, Galatians 3:11, Hebrews 10:38). Trust in God that he has already given you a new heart. Don’t ask God to change your heart any more, but instead live as if you already possess a new heart.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Most people ponder the question “What must I do to inherit the kingdom of God?” Case in point is it is the same question the rich young ruler asked Jesus in Matthew 19:16. It’s a good question, but the answer is not what most folks are looking for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-assumption&quot;&gt;The assumption&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://vacsf.org/assets/images/what-is-good-teaser.jpg&quot; style=&quot;border: 1px solid #cccccc; margin: 7px 15px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 148px; padding: 0px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;
Faithful adherents of practically all religions of the world try to solve the problem of what good deeds they must do to get to the place promised in their systems of beliefs. Resisting sins is part of the solution, part of the “good deeds” they must do, but it is still a much narrower aspect of the whole range of good deeds that they must navigate. Thus in asking such question, they’re possessed by a fallacy that they can indeed do all the good deeds required to enter God’s kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us consider the main Scripture passage of this article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;matthew-1916-22&quot;&gt;Matthew 19:16-22&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; Now someone came up to him and said, Teacher, what good thing must I do to gain eternal life? &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt; He said to him, &lt;strong&gt;Why do you ask me about what is good? There is only one who is good&lt;/strong&gt;. But if you want to enter into life, keep the commandments. &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; Which ones? he asked. Jesus replied, Do not murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not give false testimony, &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt; honor your father and mother, and love your neighbor as yourself. &lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; The young man said to him, I have wholeheartedly obeyed all these laws. What do I still lack? &lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt; Jesus said to him, &lt;strong&gt;If you wish to be perfect&lt;/strong&gt;, go sell your possessions and give the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me. &lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt; But when the young man heard this he went away sorrowful, for he was very rich.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-must-i-do&quot;&gt;What must I do?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question, posed to Jesus by the rich young ruler in the passage, is representative of the thinking of virtually everyone when it comes to the matter of salvation, or eternal life. It’s an inescapable fact. There are things to be done. There are rituals, practices, and countless methods people conjure up to perhaps satisfy some arbitrary requirements of whichever deities they worship. In my own cultural experience, though people may not possess any notion of eternal life, or any deity, they expect rewards and blessings for good deeds they’ve done in this life, and perhaps in the life beyond. All they need to do is to cross their fingers and do the right thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The young ruler’s question to Jesus is no exception, and likewise has two fundamental problems: 1) the assumption that works, some things they do, can get them into God’s kingdom, and 2) the very reference to &lt;strong&gt;good work&lt;/strong&gt; in the question. The apostle Paul addresses the first problem in most of his letters—salvation is by grace, not works—, while the error in the second problem is indirectly answered by Jesus and further confirmed throughout Scriptures, especially in Paul’s letters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;works-and-eternal-life&quot;&gt;Works and eternal life&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Works are good things all Christians should do. They give them a chance to work out their faith through gifts endowed from above, to feel a sense of personal significance as they participate in God’s works toward His kingdom, plus many other benefits. But works contribute nothing toward our entering into the kingdom of God, and His righteousness. It’s when these works are elevated as if they can make or break our relationship with God, they steal the glory of God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ephesians 2:8-9 says we’re saved by faith and not by works. Additionally, the works that we do are not something we come up with on our own, but are those that God had prepared for each and every one of His children according to His infinite wisdom: &lt;em&gt;“For we are his workmanship, having been created in Christ Jesus for good works that &lt;strong&gt;God prepared beforehand&lt;/strong&gt; so we may do them (Ephesians 2:10).”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hebrews 10:10 puts this in a different way:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;By his will we have been made holy through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all (Hebrews 10:10).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be made holy is to be set apart for God’s kingdom, the very thing sought after by the rich young ruler in Matthew 19:16. It’s not any works, even the best of good works, but the offering of the body of Christ that makes the young man holy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God clearly insists in Romans 11:6 that salvation can never be based on any works of man but by God, and He gives it freely to those who believe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And if [&lt;em&gt;salvation is&lt;/em&gt;] by grace, then it cannot be based on works; if it were, grace would no longer be grace (Romans 11:6).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can cite many more verses that will completely demolish any idea that people may enter God’s kingdom through some works of their own, but these should suffice. However the problem with most Christians is not that they don’t believe they’re saved by grace, it’s their utter dependence on works to maintain their relationship with God. They believe that the works that they do after they’re saved will make them more holy, more perfect, until the day they meet God. They call it the sanctification process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this is not what the Bible says. It says we’re both saved and then live by faith alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For by grace you are saved through faith, and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God; it is not from works, so that no one can boast (Ephesians 2:8-9).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;For the righteousness of God is revealed in the gospel &lt;strong&gt;from faith to faith&lt;/strong&gt;, just as it is written, “The righteous shall &lt;strong&gt;live by faith&lt;/strong&gt;.” (Romans 1:17; Galatians 3:11; Hebrews 10:38)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Works, those initiated and powered by the flesh, cannot get us in God’s kingdom because they neither please God nor satisfy His righteous requirements. Therefore it stands to reason that neither will these works please God in the part of life post salvation. This truth is confirmed in Romans 1:17 quoted above: &lt;em&gt;“For the righteousness of God is revealed in the gospel &lt;strong&gt;from faith to faith&lt;/strong&gt;.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Galatians Christians also committed this egregious error such that the apostle Paul had to scold them: &lt;em&gt;“Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh? (Galatians 3:3—KJV)”&lt;/em&gt; There are never supposed to be any works in a Christian’s life; works to earn salvation, works to earn God’s favor. Works that are produced through the believers as a byproduct, an outworking of the indwelling Holy Spirit, is never an issue, unless it is paraded before them so much it becomes dead works of the flesh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If faith is the only means through which you can get in God’s kingdom, it alone is the only means for you to live as a child of God. And the works that God has prepared for each individual (Ephesians 2:10) is a different kind of work altogether, as God himself will see to it that they get done, &lt;em&gt;“for it is God who works in you &lt;strong&gt;to will and to act&lt;/strong&gt; in order to fulfill his good purpose (Philippians 2:13—NIV).”&lt;/em&gt; These works are gifts from God as He gives them to us along with His Son. These works are never a measure of our standing before Him, because if they are, who among us can judge what works are good enough?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;only-god-is-good&quot;&gt;Only God is good&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you notice the peculiarity of Jesus’ response to the young man’s question? Don’t you know only God is good? And how can you who are not good produce anything good?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;No good tree bears bad fruit, nor does a bad tree bear good fruit (Luke 6:43).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it’s not only that you cannot through works get to heaven, you don’t even have what it takes to produce good works for that matter. The prophet Isaiah has this assessment of our condition: &lt;em&gt;“All of us have become like one who is unclean, and all our &lt;strong&gt;righteous acts are like filthy rags&lt;/strong&gt;; we all shrivel up like a leaf, and like the wind our sins sweep us away (Isaiah 64:6).”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, someone may argue that we have been saved so we we can do all things through Christ who strengthens us (Philippians 4:13). But is it true, that we can achieve what that was previously impossible? That Jesus’ retort to the young man no longer applies to us? That what He said, &lt;em&gt;“Only God is good,”&lt;/em&gt; no longer holds true? Nothing is further from the truth. God is still the only One who is good, and we’re still sinners saved by grace. We still suffer the consequences of the Fall. We still die, get sick, and sinful thoughts and actions still govern a large part of our lives. The only thing that is certain is our freedom from condemnation and God’s promise of eternal life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To think otherwise is to set ourselves up for constant failures that ultimately will put doubts in our minds that we may not be saved at all, because if we are, why do we still carry our body of death all day long? (Romans 7:24)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What Jesus said, &lt;em&gt;“Only God is good,”&lt;/em&gt; to the one who is fully resolved in his heart that he can no longer be led by the law in his relationship with God, but by His grace and mercies alone, is like a big boulder fallen off his back. A relief from the great burden of having to &lt;em&gt;“Be perfect (Matthew 5:48).”&lt;/em&gt; A permission to be sinners, warts and all, instead of the drudgery of the futile pursuit of trying to be like God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bearing-fruit&quot;&gt;Bearing fruit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The young man in our story attempts to do some good works to earn his place in heaven, but Jesus said good works are produced by Him and through Him after we’re already saved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“I am the vine, you are the branches. He who abides in Me, and I in him, bears much fruit; for without Me you can do nothing (John 15:5).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To think otherwise is to put the cart before the horse. The bearing of fruit is a natural byproduct of our being attached to the vine. You cannot try to induce the fruit bearing, or good works, through force or threatening, no matter how subtle. It’s the outworking of the vine, not the branches. And how do the branches abide in the vine? Through faith, the only instrument God allows Christians to abide in their Redeemer. Their fruit springs forth they know neither when nor how (John 3:8).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;The kingdom of God is like someone who spreads seed on the ground. &lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt;He goes to sleep and gets up, night and day, and the seed sprouts and grows, though &lt;strong&gt;he does not know how&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By itself the soil produces a crop&lt;/strong&gt;, first the stalk, then the head, then the full grain in the head. &lt;sup&gt;29&lt;/sup&gt;And when the grain is ripe, he sends in the sickle because the harvest has come.” (Mark 4:26-29)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An inordinate amount of energy in Christendom is spent on the growing business through all kinds of media. All these efforts end up leading people away from Christ, but toward those they revered as closer to God than themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;only-god-is-good---part-2&quot;&gt;Only God is good - part 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christians ask the same question as the young ruler all the time, in various shape or form, and for whatever reason. Before they knew Christ, they asked so they could enter heaven, now that they’ve known Him, they ask so they could please Him, to be more fit for His kingdom, to be more holy, more sanctified, more perfect. But Jesus’ response to them will still be the same: only God is perfect. Why are you asking this &lt;em&gt;“with words without knowledge (Job 38:2)?”&lt;/em&gt; The only way to access God’s throne is through the &lt;em&gt;“offering of the body of Christ once for all (Hebrews 10:10).”&lt;/em&gt; The asking of such question reveals only one thing: your pride.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Philippians 2:12 says &lt;em&gt;“work out your own salvation with fear and trembling”&lt;/em&gt;, and Christians roll up their sleeves to get busy. And more than just getting busy, they do it with fear and trembling, too. This article will show that traditional interpretations of &lt;em&gt;“work out”&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;“fear and trembling”&lt;/em&gt; are problematic and incongruous with the rest of Scriptures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;work-out-your-own-salvation&quot;&gt;Work out your own salvation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://vacsf.org/assets/images/work-out-your-own-salvation-teaser.jpg&quot; style=&quot;border: 1px solid #cccccc; margin: 7px 15px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 148px; padding: 0px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;
Now that you have received your salvation from Jesus Christ who died on the cross for your sins, it’s time you work it out, make worthwhile the sacrifice of the Son of God. GotQuestions.dot.org describes this “work out” as “… actively pursuing obedience in the process of &lt;u&gt;sanctification&lt;/u&gt; … ‘straining’ and ‘pressing on’ toward the goal of Christlikeness,” while DesiringGod.dot.org has an article with the title “Why &lt;u&gt;MUST&lt;/u&gt; We Work Out Our Salvation?” It explains the reason why: “the works we do &lt;u&gt;prove&lt;/u&gt; that our faith is real. Works are evidence of election.” Different sources give different reasons, but they all point to the need for a Christian to work out their salvation. These interpretations are also consistent with the messages I’ve heard from varying sources over the years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two key concepts in the views expressed above that go against my core belief: sanctification as a process, and works that prove our faith.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I don’t believe sanctification is a process, but it’s a once-for-all gift from God as we place our trust in Christ’s sacrifice. Let’s consider the verse below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified (Hebrews 10:14—KJV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And secondly, I don’t believe our faith must be predicated upon one or more works, because if it is, no one will ever know what work, or works, it is that qualify their faith. Ephesians 2:8-9 are probably the most well known verses that can be used to illustrate this point:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For by grace you are saved through faith, and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God; it is not from works, so that no one can boast (Ephesians 2:8-9—NET).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let’s read Philippians 2:12 in its entirety, and let’s also add verse 13 for clarity:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Wherefore, my beloved, as &lt;strong&gt;ye have always obeyed&lt;/strong&gt;, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure (Philippians 2:12-13—KJV).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As evident from this verse, the problem is not obedience as the Philippian Christians &lt;em&gt;“have always obeyed,”&lt;/em&gt; not just while Paul was with them, but even more so while he was absent. Paul didn’t write that the people SHOULD work out their salvation, or they MUST, or they should MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO, nor did he make any promise of rewards if they do, or gave veiled threats if they don’t, work out their salvation. He questioned the quality of their works, the foundation upon which they work out their salvation. Are they doing things out of envy or selfish ambition? Or are they doing it out of the love for the brethren?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no doubt from the reading of Philippians 2 that the focus is not with the concern whether they work out their salvation, but with how they should do the works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;with-fear-and-trembling&quot;&gt;With fear and trembling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really didn’t have to labor the point as it is rather clear that verse 13 explains the true meaning of  &lt;em&gt;“with fear and trembling.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A New Covenant Christian no longer operates from the realm of the flesh, but from a spirit of grace where he knows everything he does, he deserves no credit, of which he should not boast, for it is God who works in him &lt;em&gt;“both to will and to do of His good pleasure.”&lt;/em&gt; Whenever the flesh is involved, there is self-glorification, and boasting. Ephesians 2:8-9 says since we’re saved by grace, and not by works, we have no reason to boast about ourselves or our abilities. In Romans 3:27, the apostle Paul also discouraged people from boasting as he pointed out to the Romans that they now lived under a new law, one that required faith, not works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, when a New Covenant Christian still uses the law as his guide, he will always look to himself as the prime mover in all his actions. If he does what is expected of him, he gets the blessings, and conversely, if he does not, he stands a chance of losing out on his blessings. This mindset creates an environment where boasting and self promotion thrive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, Paul must have used the phrase &lt;em&gt;“fear and trembling”&lt;/em&gt; as a contrast to the opposite attitude of pride, for the reason being &lt;em&gt;“it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.”&lt;/em&gt;  It is God, not you! So don’t go and strut your stuff, don’t brag about what good things you’ve done for God. Paul does not mean at all that the working out of our salvation involves any sense of duty, obedience, gratitude, reciprocation to what Jesus had done for us, or any other guilt producing motivation at all. He didn’t need to because his audience the Philippians &lt;em&gt;“have always obeyed.”&lt;/em&gt; The danger they faced was not that they were lazy, but in the attitude of their heart involving only one thing: Are they relying on God’s grace, or their own works, in their relationship with God? Do they know that it is God who works in them both &lt;em&gt;“to will and to do”&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is really no need for anyone to serve God in “fear and trembling,” in the atmosphere expected under a ruthless taskmaster. Paul articulated strenuously in several epistles the case for our relating to God through grace only, not works. Paul is also the one who asks us to grow up and stop feeding on the basic teaching of repentance from dead works, or vice versa repentance from NOT doing good works (Hebrews 6:1-2). Therefore, far be it from him to preach “fear and trembling” in the literal sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;working-what-out&quot;&gt;Working WHAT out?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most Christians assume the working out of our salvation involves only things pertaining to faith. Some examples are: going to church, bible study, revival camp, spiritual retreats, evangelistic outreach, preaching the gospel, etc. But did Jesus die to redeem us only for these things? Or he died to restore all the things that make us who we are? Our profession, hope, aspiration, fear, sorrow, pain, joy, weaknesses, strength, personality, ideosyncrasies, and many things that made King David exclaim &lt;em&gt;“I praise you because I’m fearfully and wonderfully made”&lt;/em&gt; (Psalm 139:14).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To work out your salvation is to live the life that God made you in the first place, but with a difference. You used to live in self pity, but now you’re loved by God. You used to indulge in sinful activities to get temporary relief from pain but now, with hearts full of love from God, you’re set free to know the difference. You used to live a life without meaning but now you know you have a special place in the heart of God and his eternal kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t need anyone to tell you that you need to breathe fresh air to live, so it is with the working out of your salvation. It is God who creates this wonderful air for you to breathe, it is also him who works in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure. The caveat is tread lightly, don’t become filled with prideful arrogance, but if there is an attitude you should have, it should be of fear and trembling as you did nothing to deserve even the salvation that you have.&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary type="text">Philippians 2:12 says “work out your own salvation with fear and trembling”, and Christians roll up their sleeves to get busy. And more than just getting busy, they do it with fear and trembling, too. This article will show that traditional interpretations of “work out” and “fear and trembling” are problematic and incongruous with the rest of Scriptures.</summary>

    &lt;p&gt;What seems to preoccupy most Christians is the issue of sin, both of the things you should do but don’t do, and of the things you should not do but you do. The same thing is also true with the majority of Christian teaching which is dedicated toward solving this perennial problem. But the key verse we’re studying in this article denounces it as elementary teaching while it admonishes us to move on to maturity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;repentance&quot;&gt;Repentance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://vacsf.org/assets/images/repentance-from-dead-works-teaser.jpg&quot; style=&quot;border: 1px solid #cccccc; margin: 7px 15px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 148px; padding: 0px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;
The irony is it is the very issue of sin that drives people to Jesus, but it still plagues them years after they came to Christ. In their mind, they believe their sins are forgiven once and for all when they placed their trust in Christ, and through that faith they have eternal life, access to God through prayer, and many other fundamental beliefs. However, there seems to be a great disparity between what they believe in theory—the church’s doctrines that they hold—, and how they live out these beliefs in real life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quick survey on the internet shows the following definition of repentance:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“What is repentance? Is it just a single decision that leads to baptism? No, it also must be an ongoing frame of mind, recognizing that &lt;strong&gt;overcoming sin is a lifetime effort&lt;/strong&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overcoming sin as an ongoing frame of mind, and a lifetime effort. My decades of listening to sermons in church or on the radio, and book reading shows the statement above is quite accurate of the approach most Christians take in their walk with God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So out of the desire to be more thorough in laying the groundwork for this article, I continued to survey the internet for more opinions on this topic of repentance. The more I searched, the heavier the burden I felt, but the peculiar thing is, in as many exhortations as I found, no one gave a clear answer as to how a Christian can reliably get to where they’re supposed to go. Let’s consider this quote from J. I. Packer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Repentance means turning from &lt;strong&gt;as much as you know&lt;/strong&gt; of your sin to give &lt;strong&gt;as much as you know&lt;/strong&gt; of yourself to &lt;strong&gt;as much as you know&lt;/strong&gt; of your God, and as our knowledge grows at these three points so &lt;strong&gt;our practice of repentance has to be enlarged&lt;/strong&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As much as you know? Clear as mud, isn’t it? How much must I know so I can come to a state of resolution where my soul may rest? Hurriedly, I closed all the browser tabs opened up for searches on repentance, as the more I searched, the more confused I became. There wasn’t a single thing I could find that would help people do consistently to maintain their peace with God. There is though one silver lining in this endeavor, I was reminded of how far I’ve come since I came to Christ. The heaviness I felt, the great burden on my back much like that which was on Christian’s back in John Bunyan’s Pilgrim’s Progress, was reminiscent of the years before I found peace with God. Such longing for peace, for self acceptance, for life’s meaning. Why do these pillars of faith make people more confused? Why don’t they point them to the real solution? Or maybe they only pretend to know the answer?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, I wasn’t looking for an answer for myself, but for my readers who are still struggling to find that place of rest. I found this wonderful rest that is written in Hebrews 4:11 and out of exceeding joy I’m now pointing others to it. The path to it doesn’t require any work, nor any repentance as I shall prove later, but it does require one thing: to believe, even with a faith as small as a mustard seed. Now back to our discourse on repentance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are as many views on the meaning of repentance as there are denominations multiplied by the number of individuals with their own experiences. This article does not aim to prove the correctness or errors of certain views, but it aims to question whether the most commonly accepted view of repentance, with the overcoming of sin as its most dominant objective, in the Christian world view of an average believer, is what God has in mind for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-knowledge-of-good-and-evil&quot;&gt;The knowledge of good and evil&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repentance is not a new concept, as a matter of fact it’s almost as old as time itself when the knowledge of good and evil began to inhabit the hearts of Adam and Eve after they ate of the forbidden fruit, and this was perhaps many millennia before the Ten Commandments were given. This new knowledge began to create inner conflicts in the heart of man with the deafening voice of their conscience constantly either accusing or defending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For whenever the Gentiles, who do not have the law, do by nature the things required by the law, these who do not have the law are a law to themselves. They show that the work of the law is written in their hearts, as their conscience bears witness and their conflicting thoughts accuse or else defend them (Romans 2:14-15).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to the Fall in Eden, there was no need for repentance for man did not possess the knowledge of good and evil. But now with a ruthless judge dwelling in their conscience, surely there must be responses either of denial, or tears of repentance, or inner conflicts that put them in great turmoil. Then the Lord God reduced the breadth of the conscience-based law into a set of clearer, easier to grasp, standards, the Ten Commandments, so man can more easily measure themselves, so that perhaps they may realize how far they have fallen short of God’s glory and be more willing to place their trust in the Messiah when he comes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-vicious-cycle&quot;&gt;The vicious cycle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So over the ages, man sinned and they repented, and the cycle repeats over and over again, the vicious cycle of sin and repentance. How many thousand more years before they can break free from it? Granted they can offer sacrifices, or verbal confessions, for their sins, but those are only temporary measures until they sin again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The law is only a shadow of the good things that are coming—not the realities themselves. For this reason it can never, by the same sacrifices repeated endlessly year after year, make perfect those who draw near to worship. Otherwise, would they not have stopped being offered? For the worshipers would have been cleansed once for all, and would &lt;strong&gt;no longer have felt guilty&lt;/strong&gt; for their sins. But those sacrifices are an annual reminder of sins. It is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins (Hebrews 10:1-4).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you notice the words in bold face above? It indicates there is an effective remedy for the issue of sin which would once for all cleanse the worshippers and remove their guilty conscience. Here are what that remedy is NOT. It’s not sacrifices of bull and goats. It’s not your confession of sins. It’s not your penances or whatever forms of making amends. It is the body of Christ:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Then he said, “Here I am, I have come to do your will.” He sets aside the first to establish the second. And by that will, we have been made holy through the sacrifice of the &lt;strong&gt;body of Jesus Christ once for all&lt;/strong&gt; (Hebrews 10:9-10).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;breaking-free&quot;&gt;Breaking free&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the repentance God wants. Not the kind of repentance to be repeated over and over again of dead works, or of the bad things that we do, but a once-for-all kind of repentance of the ultimate sin of unbelief. This repentance has to do with our trusting that though we will still sin until the day we die, Christ’s death on the cross gives us a once-for-all forgiveness of sins that breaks the cycle to set us free. Dare you believe what Hebrews 10:2 says: &lt;em&gt;“no longer have felt guilty for their sins”&lt;/em&gt;? Is God promoting sins by giving man such freedom from a guilty conscience? No, because elsewhere in Scriptures it is written that a conscience free from guilt actually promotes holy living.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we come to the verse that gives this article its title:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;So let us stop going over the basic teachings about Christ again and again. Let us go on instead and become mature in our understanding. Surely we don’t need to start again with the fundamental importance of repenting from evil deeds and placing our faith in God (Hebrews 6:1—New Living Translation)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doesn’t this sound familiar, if you’re a faithful churchgoer who never missed a Sunday sermon? Of course, I’m exaggerating as who wouldn’t miss a Sunday or two. Repenting from evil deeds and faith in God are the two most common underlying themes no matter what topic is being addressed. Furthermore, the Hebrews author calls them “basic teachings,” or elementary teachings in some other translations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what’s wrong with a good dose of teaching that all Christians must repent from evil deeds? And what’s wrong with teaching that Christians should have faith in God?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;repentance-from-dead-works&quot;&gt;Repentance from dead works&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t make sense that Christians must be reminded ad nauseum that they should repent from dead works, or from sinful actions. Even a child know that, or to take it further, even an unbeliever know that. How do we know that? Let’s quote again the verse shown earlier in the “Knowledge of good and evil” section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For whenever the Gentiles, who do not have the law, do by nature the things required by the law, these who do not have the law are a law to themselves. They show that the work of the law is written in their hearts, as their conscience bears witness and their conflicting thoughts accuse or else defend them (Romans 2:14-15).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The knowledge of good and evil ensures that every descendant of Adam and Eve is capable of repentance, especially repentance from bad deeds to be more specific. Some among them may choose certain course of action in response to their inner voices, by shedding tears of sorrow, or determining in their heart to never repeat the same mistakes, or finding ways to quiet the accusing voices. No matter what their choices are, the capacity for repentance is present as a result of their possessing the knowledge of good and evil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore if an unbeliever, a spiritually dead person, knows intimately the meaning of repentance from evil deeds, shouldn’t a Christian, one who is indwelled by the Third Person of the Godhead, know any less? Wouldn’t the Spirit of God who breathed life into them guide them in the way everlasting?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, the problem Christians have is not that they sin and they love their sins, but &lt;em&gt;“For I do not do the good I want, but I do the very evil I do not want! (Romans 7:19).”&lt;/em&gt; Such is the common experience of genuine born again believers, even including the apostle Paul himself. They hate the evil things that they do. What Paul said is contrary to the volume of teaching we hear everyday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why all the teaching on this aspect is considered childish, elementary, and basic, by the Hebrews’ author who seems to say: Please, no more basic stuff; there’s no need to keep telling Christians of sins and repentance. They’re wracked with guilt already, and don’t know how to break free from the cycle of sin and repentance. Therefore, to teach them to sin no more is to keep them going round and round in the desert of sin and repentance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;have-faith-in-god&quot;&gt;Have faith in God&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though this article’s title does not contain this part of the key verse, it might as well be tackled as part of the “elementary teaching” dismissed by the Hebrews’ author, since what that makes a Christian go to church, to tune to Christian radio, to buy a Christian book, is their faith in God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it’s entirely possible that their faith in God is like a bruised reed or a smoldering wick (Matthew 12:20), they should be built up in a manner different than constant exhortation that they should have faith in God. The focus should be on the object of their faith, not in faith itself. The more they know the object of their faith, the stronger their faith will be. And we know what it is, the object of their faith, that is the Lord Jesus Christ, as included with Him are all the wonderful things he’s accomplished for them, from the forgiveness of their sins to the assurance of their salvation, and to the full righteousness that he bestowed on them as children of God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, focus on the object of their faith, not in faith itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-real-dead-works&quot;&gt;The real dead works&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But is the Hebrews writer talking about the same dead works as what is being taught predominantly in the church? Most sermons I heard and books I read seem to refer to dead works as sinful actions, even the NLT version of Hebrews 6:1 uses the term &lt;em&gt;“evil deeds,”&lt;/em&gt;but if dead works are the same as sins then how do you explain Ephesians 2:8-9 which says we’re saved by grace, not works? The works in this Ephesians context are not sinful activities, but flesh-powered deeds toward salvation, therefore to equate these dead works with sins is to compare apples with oranges. This is exactly how the parts leading to Hebrews 6:1 describe dead works: the works that are as good as dead in their effort to save man, the old sacrificial system, the reliance on human effort to attain God’s righteousness. Christians must repent from relying on their fleshly efforts, or dead works for that matter. In this sense, flesh-based pious deeds are actually evil according to the Hebrews context, and the term &lt;em&gt;“dead works”&lt;/em&gt; does not refer at all to sins common to man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dead works are not bad behaviors, they’re not only useless toward salvation, they may actually alienate man from God (Galatians 5:4).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hebrews 6:1 tells us that the elementary foundation of &lt;em&gt;“repentance from dead works,”&lt;/em&gt; and of &lt;em&gt;“faith in God,”&lt;/em&gt; should have been already firmly grasped by the believers, so no more effort should be spent on such basic understanding. Only then can we move on to maturity. The sad thing though is the majority of Christians still rely on dead works and still don’t place their full faith in what Christ had already accomplished on the cross. This must be the reason why the major epistles such as Romans, Galatians, Colossians, and Hebrews, had to be written to address this very issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-apostasy&quot;&gt;The apostasy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, it may be beneficial to address Hebrews 6:4-6 which tends to be just as easily misunderstood as the preceding verse 1 involving &lt;em&gt;“dead works.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For it is impossible in the case of those who have once been enlightened, tasted the heavenly gift, become partakers of the Holy Spirit,  tasted the good word of God and the miracles of the coming age,  and then have committed &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;apostasy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;renew them again to repentance&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, since they are &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;crucifying the Son of God for themselves all over again&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and holding him up to contempt. (Hebrews 6:4-6)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the true meaning of &lt;em&gt;“dead works”&lt;/em&gt; can be accepted as not being behavioral sinful actions but as flesh-based pious deeds that have no true spiritual value, the true meaning of the concepts in bold text above can be arrived at from the same context. The apostasy is the returning to the law, the repentance is the turning away from flesh-powered pious deeds toward faith alone in Christ’s finished work on the cross, and the crucifying again of the Son of God is the refusal to believe that Christ had dealt with the sin issue of his believer once for all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;in-conclusion&quot;&gt;In conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I became a Christian in my mid-thirties after many years of searching for ways to get relief for my burdened soul. O how I came to the foot of the cross with so much joy. But it didn’t take long before I came back full circle to work-based religion, and engaged in &lt;em&gt;“dead works”&lt;/em&gt; for almost three decades that followed. I got busier with church activities with ever increasing burden but ever decreasing joy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article, though had been written around Sept 2017, has now been revised with much more clarity thanks to a reader  who gave insightful comments which forced me to revisit Hebrews and came to a more complete understanding of the key concept that gave this writing its title. I’m eternally grateful.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Almost all Christians must have heard at least more than once sermons that encourage them to deny themselves, take up their cross, and follow Jesus as both a commandment and a promise that they would experience peace, joy, and ultimately a more fulfilling Christian life. Is this what Jesus had in mind when he spoke these words?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://vacsf.org/assets/images/deny-yourself-teaser.jpg&quot; style=&quot;border: 1px solid #cccccc; margin: 7px 15px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 148px; padding: 0px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;
At first glance, the three aspects of what Jesus spoke in Matthew 16:24 appear to be achievable goals, and Christians set out to achieve these goals with a vengeance. A huge amount of communication is dedicated toward teaching Christians how to achieve a measure of success toward these goals. But is a measure of success good enough? For certainly Jesus was not speaking to those who were already in God’s kingdom, but to the lost world of the requirements for entering it. He is posing an impossible standard that only he could achieve: to deny one’s self, to bear the cross, and to follow in his footstep. This article will show that these are not challenges to see who qualifies for God’s kingdom, but are stern ominous shouts from the One who is going to the cross: “Will you surrender?”. We should not hear it with any less alarm than the terrifying scene around mount Sinai when the law was about to be delivered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article was inspired from a verse that was quoted at the end of an email. This verse, which I had heard sermons on it several times in my decades of sitting in my church pews, over the radio, or through Christian literature that I devoured in my early years as a Christian, became my life’s purpose years before Rick Warren’s Purpose Driven Life was written.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;matthew-1624&quot;&gt;Matthew 16:24&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me (Matthew 16:24)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you hover over this verse Matthew 16:24 and right-click to open it in a new window or tab, you’d find a short commentary on the verse: “Discipleship is costly.” This subtitle is found in the NASB, Amplified, and various other versions. No, discipleship is much more than being costly, it’s priceless. It took God’s only begotten Son to pay for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;self-denial&quot;&gt;Self denial&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To what extent does Jesus ask you to deny yourself? Denying yourself of certain pleasures by restricting certain foods or drinks, or follow the pattern of the Colossians who prescribed “do not handle, do not taste, do not touch” (Colossians 2:21), or other forms of personal sacrifice? No, Hebrews 9:22 says that &lt;em&gt;“without the shedding of blood there can be no forgiveness of sins.”&lt;/em&gt; And it’s not just a spilling of some blood, it’s all of it until death, and that was what Jesus did. He died. The condition for becoming his disciple, for following him, is not just mere denial of something, but a denial unto death through the shedding of your own blood. And even then, when you did shed your own blood, it wouldn’t do you any good because you don’t qualify as an unblemished sacrifice. The Old Covenant requirement for sacrificial beasts is they have to be accepted by the High Priest as unblemished. Jesus is unblemished but you are not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now why am I talking about death when the verse only talks about self denial? Because Jesus spoke these words as a condition for salvation, not discipleship. The New Covenant was not yet made available until Christ denied himself by enduring the cross. He was asking his listener though they did not know what he was alluding to: can you endure what I’m about to endure? But of course, this is just a rhetorical question, because your death on the cross will not yield the righteousness you need for an entrance into God’s kingdom, as I had alluded to earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is another aspect of self that no sinner can deny. It’s their Adamic nature. No matter what amount of obedience or lawkeeping can rid them off the part of them that the apostle Paul referred to as he cried: &lt;em&gt;“Wretched man that I am! Who will rescue me from this &lt;strong&gt;body of death&lt;/strong&gt;?”&lt;/em&gt; It’s the part that became ours when Adam and Eve lost eternal life in the garden of Eden. Self denial is a pipe dream, but it became a reality for us when we came to trust in Christ who died on our behalf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For you have died and your life is hidden with Christ in God (Colossians 3:3).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is how you deny yourself, by the grace of God and by your faith in the One who God had sent to die for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;take-up-your-cross&quot;&gt;Take up your cross&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is just a continuation of the denial of self explained above. The cross requires the one who carries it to end up at the point of death. It’s not at all the kind of cross people generally think of, the cross of life’s struggles, or of trials and tribulations. It’s the cross to pay for someone’s sin, and, as discussed earlier in the self denial section, no one is qualified to endure such cross except Jesus Christ. In short, can you endure a cross to the point of death?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;following-jesus&quot;&gt;Following Jesus&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again, Jesus does not simply call men to become his disciples, but he calls them first to become children of God, citizens of his kingdom, to pass from death to life, or to put it simply to be saved. While he spoke Matthews 16:24, He was still preparing the world to receive his free gift of life through his death on the cross. Jesus was using the language of the world when he called them to follow him. Adherents of other religions follow their leaders while Christians enjoy the fellowship with Jesus making his abode in their hearts. He no longer calls those who trust in him servants, but friends and children of God. The work that we do as citizens of God’s kingdom is just a byproduct, an inevitable consequence of us being attached to the Vine, having the full right to become children of God, and sealed by his Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-new-and-living-way&quot;&gt;A new and living way&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This verse Matthew 16:24 is not the basis of the new ministry of reconciliation, but the old ministry of condemnation. It should give any Christian a shudder had God not given us a new way to draw near to him through his Son. We’d find bodies of Christians strewn about as each attempts to obey its impossible command to make peace with God. Ah, but here’s the irony, had they tried to crucify themselves, to chop off their hands and feet, to pluck out their eyes, to sell all their possessions to give to the poor, they would have quickly discovered the futility of such attempts as they still wouldn’t know to what extent they must go to meet God’s righteous requirements. But thankfully:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Therefore, brothers, since we have confidence to enter the Most Holy Place by the blood of Jesus, by a &lt;strong&gt;new and living way&lt;/strong&gt; opened for us through the curtain, that is, &lt;strong&gt;his body&lt;/strong&gt; (Hebrews 10:19-20)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s his body, not ours. Go in peace.&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary type="text">Almost all Christians must have heard at least more than once sermons that encourage them to deny themselves, take up their cross, and follow Jesus as both a commandment and a promise that they would experience peace, joy, and ultimately a more fulfilling Christian life. Is this what Jesus had in mind when he spoke these words?</summary>

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“In him you also were circumcised - not, however, with a circumcision performed by human hands, but by the removal of the fleshly body, that is, through the circumcision done by Christ.  Having been buried with him in baptism, you also have been raised with him through your faith in the power of God who raised him from the dead (Colossians 2:11-12—NET).”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://vacsf.org/assets/images/putting-off-of-the-body-of-the-flesh-teaser.jpg&quot; style=&quot;border: 1px solid #cccccc; margin: 7px 15px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 148px; padding: 0px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;
An article of a similar topic was written previously under the title &lt;a href=&quot;http://vacsf.org/articles/Mortify-the-Deeds-of-the-Flesh/&quot;&gt;“Mortify The Deeds Of The Flesh.”&lt;/a&gt; This article is not a rewrite, but another look at it from a different angle based on a different verse. It is inspired from a sermon I heard at a Summer camp based on Colossians 2:11-12. During the sermon, the speaker refered to R. C. Sproul’s Coram Deo on the same verse. Interestingly, as I queried the world wide web to take the pulse of the general population in how they interpret these verses, R. C. Sproul’s Coram Deo on Colossians 2:11-12 showed up as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Our old Adamic nature has been mortally wounded, but it refuses to stay buried. Having a new nature in Christ, we must put sin to death when it rises up. This means that we must resist temptation and repent when we give in, for we will not be perfect until we are in heaven. Calvin comments on today’s passage that “burial expresses a continued process of mortification.” Sin is powerless to control us, but it is still dangerous and must be resisted.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;(excerpted from original article at: http://www.ligonier.org/learn/devotionals/dead-and-buried-with-christ/).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several key concepts in this Coram Deo of R. C. Sproul need to be checked against foundational truths found in Scriptures, and especially in the immediate context of the verses in question. These concepts are embraced by virtually all in Christianity though they’re unbiblical and can wreck havoc in the life of believers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mortally-wounded&quot;&gt;Mortally wounded&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Coram Deo: Our old Adamic nature has been mortally wounded, but it refuses to stay buried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know that we’re sinners not because of the sinful things that we do, or the good things that we fail to do, but because of what comes from deep inside: our sin nature. Whether or not we commit any of these sins, we’re sinners. Jesus said so himself: &lt;em&gt;“What defiles a person is not what goes into the mouth; it is what comes out of the mouth that defiles a person (Matthew 15:11).”&lt;/em&gt; Then how can it be that our sin nature is “mortally wounded” yet still manages to produce sins? No, our Adamic nature will never be completely dead until we as believers put on the incorruptible (1 Corinthians 15:52-54). Until then, it’s alive and well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, our Adamic nature is only mortally wounded in the sense that its sin no longer has the power to condemn us as we have been released from the law (Romans 7:6).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;put-sin-to-death&quot;&gt;Put sin to death&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Coram Deo continued: Having a new nature in Christ, we must put sin to death when it rises up. This means that we must resist temptation and repent when we give in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no doubt that any transgression causes great pain to both the transgressor and those who are in its path of destruction. With few exceptions, all Christians know the painful consequences of sins, and they know that should, and must, resist temptations. Even unbelievers know and are fearful of what price they have to pay when they fall. They don’t need to go to church to learn what even a child knows, as wisdom cries out in the marketplace (Proverbs 1:20).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about repentance in the context of the Coram Deo? By the time a sin had been committed, repentance would be useless. So is an apology as it would be just lip service. It’s better not to fall into sin at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Lord, however, provides us with a way to deal with sin in the event we fall into temptation. Not repentance, not remorse, not shedding of crocodile tears, not lip service of apology, but an assurance that our citizenship of God’s kingdom will still be in tact:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous (1 John 2:1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because we have Jesus, the Advocate, who sits besides God the Father to plead our case. What do you think is stronger? Our repentance or Jesus’ defense? Even our offering of ourselves to be nailed on a cross for our sins would be no match for the powerful defense of the Attorney-at-Law—as a matter of fact, God will not accept our own crucifixion on the cross as a substitution for our sins as none of us are “unblemished” enough to qualify. This is where God’s way is not our way is exemplified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, if our lifelong goal is to battle sins, we’d be fighting a losing battle, or going about it the wrong way. It’s infinitely better to fix our eyes on Christ than on our enemy the devil. I have a great real-life example to demonstrate this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a Christian sister at our church who works in the service industry. She asked me for an advise on how to deal with someone among her customers who frequently tried to seduce her. My advise to her was to fix her eyes on Jesus, to regularly come to Him to draw from Him strength that comes as a result of an assurance of her salvation, His unconditional love, His total forgiveness of her sins, and many other wonderful gifts that God gave her along with His Son.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now if she chose a different approach, the one suggested by the Coram Deo or common exhortations, she would, throughout the day, even while she is at home, prepare herself to say no to the temptation. She would most likely imagine herself being in the same situation, going through different scenarios, and so on so forth. Do you get the drift of where this is going? She would end up, in her mind, being with the man all day long even while she is at home. Is this the way you prepare yourself to resist temptations?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a child of God live, breath, and rest in their identity as children of God, as they set their minds on things above, they will be more ready to battle sins when they come. But if they are constantly thinking of sins, even thinking of how to resist sins, they will more likely fall when temptations do come, they will be like soldiers who are worn out from sleepless night worrying about their enemies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fix your eyes on Jesus then you will be more able to resist sins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the Israelites were bitten by snakes in the desert, God instructed Moses to hang a bronze snake on a pole so whoever lift up their eyes upon the snake after being bitten would not die. There was no need for Moses to remind folks to try to avoid getting snake bites, or to repent upon getting bitten, but that they just needed to lift up their eyes to behold the bronze snake. The bites are painful and deadly enough as a deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;…  if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous (1 John 2:1).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up: That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life (John 3:14-15).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;perfecting-the-self&quot;&gt;Perfecting the self&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Coram Deo continued: … for we will not be perfect until we are in heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This part of the Coram Deo says that our life’s purpose is to pursue perfection though we will not be able to reach it until we’re heaven. This idea of Christians working toward perfection is unbiblical in several aspects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, Jesus had stated in Matthew 5:48: &lt;em&gt;“Be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect,”&lt;/em&gt; which means if you’re not ALREADY perfect, you will not be ushered into God’s presence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, the apostle Paul also expressed his dismay in Galatians 3:3: &lt;em&gt;“Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh?”&lt;/em&gt; Having begun in the Spirit, having been born again from above, having what it takes to boldly enter the throne of grace, and you’re still trying to get more perfect through your flesh? By battling with your sin? Didn’t Christ already circumcise you? And if He already removed your corrupt nature (verse 11), which part of you is still not perfect? (Keep in mind that though you will still sin until the day you die, you’re perfect in God’s eyes as He sees you through His perfect Son)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, Hebrews 10:14 says this: &lt;em&gt;“For by one sacrifice he has made perfect forever those who are being made holy.”&lt;/em&gt; By one sacrifice, the sacrifice of the Lamb or God, not by the continual resisting or repenting in relation to sin. And if Christ already made you perfect forever then what are you perfecting?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these verses, and many more that can be found in Scriptures, point to the fact that our perfection is not arrived at through our personal effort in dealing with sin, but through what Christ did alone. All our effort in dealing with sins is like trying to deal with pimples while there is a cancerous corrupt nature inside that only Christ could deal with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;continued-process-of-mortification&quot;&gt;Continued process of mortification&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Coram Deo continued: Calvin comments on today’s passage that “burial expresses a continued process of mortification.” Sin is powerless to control us, but it is still dangerous and must be resisted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are we being buried alive? Being buried and continue to die? The Bible doesn’t say this is how we die. It says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Therefore we have been buried with him through baptism into death, in order that just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we too may live a new life (Romans 6:4).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have been buried with Christ. It’s a done deal. Furthermore:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Having been buried with him in baptism, you also have been raised with him through your faith in the power of God who raised him from the dead (Colossians 2:12).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This verse gives further clarification that we were not only buried with Christ, we died with Him, too, as no one can be raised unless he’s already dead. Jesus spoke of this truth in no uncertain terms:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Truly, truly, I tell you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains by itself alone. But if it dies, it bears much fruit (John 12:24).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The being raised back to life is implied here in the &lt;em&gt;“bears much fruit”&lt;/em&gt; part of the verse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These verses show us clearly that the “continued process of mortification” concept is not found at all in the Bible, yet we find it underlying messages virtually throughout Christiandom—or perhaps it is a milder version of purgatory? The Bible passages cited in this writing is, by no means exhaustive but sufficiently representative, to show gross misinterpretations and applications of Colossians 2:11-12 as a case in point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;in-conclusion&quot;&gt;In conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you notice the contrast between Colossians 2:11-12 and the Coram Deo?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Scripture passage conveys a sense of liberation, of triumph, with Christ as the prime mover in accomplishing the great task of taking away our sin nature. But most importantly, a sense of finality, that the work to present us as being ready to enter into the presence of the Most High, to boldly enter the throne of grace, has been accomplished. Christ the Giver, and us the recipients of an undeserved favor. Therefore we keep looking up to Christ the starter and the finisher of our faith.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Coram Deo projects something completely different. It tells us to engage in morbid introspection, to take our eyes off of Christ and focus on ourselves and the enemy of our souls. It tells us to go back to the desert as there are formidable giants in the promised land. It tells us that now is NOT the acceptable time, now is NOT the day of salvation (2 Corinthians 6:2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t believe in the Coram Deo, but believe in Colossians 2:11-12. Take it at its face value. There is now no longer a bronze snake, but there is Christ who sits on the right hand of God to plead your case that you are perfect—despite numerous snake bites.

    &lt;p&gt;Before Jesus took his last breath on the cross, he said: &lt;em&gt;“It’s finished.”&lt;/em&gt; So just as God rested after he completed the work of creation, Jesus rested after he completed the work of saving man. It is his will that we enter this rest, yet so many Christians do not experience it, their walk with God is still weighed down with burdens as they try to achieve what only Jesus could achieve for them, and he had already done so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://vacsf.org/assets/images/entering-Gods-rest-teaser.jpg&quot; style=&quot;border: 1px solid #cccccc; margin: 7px 15px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 148px; padding: 0px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;
The burden that man must carry is both physical and spiritual, however, Jesus came to address mainly the later. Physical burden must be born by both believers and unbelievers alike, some enjoy a life of ease while others toil for their survival irrespective of spiritual condition. But when Jesus spoke the following well known verse: &lt;em&gt;“Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest” (Matthew 11:28)&lt;/em&gt;, was he not also talking about the physical burden, or perhaps at least together with the spiritual as well?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it is Jesus’ will to relieve us of our physical burden, such as ill health, financial issues, etc., he would have easily solved them through various physical means. If he could create the universe and everything in it, he could very well restore your good health, and give you resources to fix your financial problems. Jesus didn’t die to provide solutions to man’s physical problems, he died for their sins, and the guilt that weighed them down. Therefore the burden of man that must be lifted is the burden of sin which can only be accomplished by Christ on the cross on our behalf. This burden is uniquely a spiritual one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;religious-burden&quot;&gt;Religious burden&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Woe to you, experts in the law and you Pharisees, hypocrites! You cross land and sea to make one convert, and when you get one, you make him twice as much a child of hell as yourselves!” (Matthew 23:15)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pharisees make people children of hell not in the sense that they teach them to do evil things, or things against the law of God, but religious traditions which in reality drove them apart from him. They &lt;em&gt;“study the scriptures thoroughly because they think in them they possess eternal life, and it is these same scriptures that testify about Jesus” (John 5:39)&lt;/em&gt;. The scriptures became their god instead of the true God that the words pointed them to. In their mistaken notions, they pile the burden of the keeping of the law on believers, which in effect drives a wedge between them and God. The apostle Paul wrote clearly about this faulty belief as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A person is &lt;strong&gt;not justified by the works of the law, but by faith in Jesus Christ&lt;/strong&gt;. So we, too, have put our faith in Christ Jesus that we may be justified by faith in Christ and not by the works of the law, because &lt;strong&gt;by the works of the law no one will be justified&lt;/strong&gt; (Galatians 2:16).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, some may argue that they don’t preach the law for justification, but for sanctification. But the end result is the same, that though God may by his grace and mercies saves anyone who is in Christ, a believer’s life becomes a perpetual motion in trying to become “more sanctified,” to “please the Lord,” and even to meet expectations of others though oftentimes they are not at all based on any Biblical truths. Even demons believe certain things about God (James 2:19) but they’re far from having a trust relationship with God. Such is a relationship that many have with God. They view God through a lens almost universally held by all religions of the world. They see a God with expectations and goals that are impossible to achieve. They see a God who is ready to nail them for every little mistake they make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their burden is not physical, but purely a spiritual one. They always felt they needed to get right with God through the keeping of the law. We saw this in the book of Acts, when the apostles and leaders of the church in Jerusalem met to debate whether to impose the law of Moses on Gentile believers, the apostle Peter argued against it saying:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;Brothers, you know that some time ago God chose me to preach to the Gentiles so they would hear the message of the gospel and believe. &lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;And God, who knows the heart, has testified to them by giving them the Holy Spirit just as he did to us, &lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;and he made no distinction between them and us, cleansing their hearts by faith. &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;So now why are you putting God to the test by &lt;strong&gt;placing on the neck of the disciples a yoke that neither our ancestors nor we have been able to bear?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;On the contrary, we believe that we are saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus, in the same way as they are (Acts 15:7-11).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The burden that neither their ancestors nor they could bear. This was the type of burden that Jesus promised he would deliver us from. Therefore, the deliverance from the demand of the law was the “rest” that Jesus hinted at when he made the promise in Matthew 11:28. It was also this rest that the author of Hebrews 4:11 asks us to make every effort to enter into. And it is also this rest that God had given the Israelites in the form of the observance of the Sabbath day as a foreshadow of the true rest in Christ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;jesus-yoke-and-burden&quot;&gt;Jesus’ yoke and burden&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus’ yoke and burden is the cross and the sin of the world. When he asks us to take his yoke, he does not mean it in the same way most folks understand. His yoke is the cross that requires his death, and only his death is meaningful as it is the only sacrifice that can meet God’s requirement as the payment for the sin of the world. Therefore he could not have asked us to do the thing that only he could do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore to take up Jesus’ yoke can only mean to accept his free gift of the cross as if we ourselves died on the cross. This truth is presented in several passages in Scriptures that the death that was counted toward us was a done deal, that though we haven’t physically died, we are considered dead toward everything that Jesus died for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We were therefore buried with him&lt;/strong&gt; through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life (Romans 6:4).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;But now, &lt;strong&gt;having died&lt;/strong&gt; to what bound us, we &lt;strong&gt;have been released from the Law&lt;/strong&gt;, so that we serve in the new way of the Spirit, and not in the old way of the written code (Romans 7:6).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you noticed the past tense in these verses? We’re still alive and yet we were considered as buried with Christ, as having died and been released from the law. It’s the same way with the yoke that Jesus took and counted it toward us so our debt may be considered paid in full.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus paid it all so we may enter that precious rest that all of mankind have been longing for since the time of Adam. Jesus took the burden, the burden so huge that it encompasses all of the sins of man since the beginning of time and forevermore, so that we don’t have to bear it. The need to continually pay for each and every single sin of ours is now replaced by the once-for-all payment by the Son of God on the cross. Now those who accept Jesus’ payment as his own may rest. And this rest is not just a nice thing to have, it’s actually commanded to us in Scriptures:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Let us, therefore, make every effort to enter that rest (Hebrews 4:11).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effort we must make is not in doing something no matter how noble, but in trying to get into that place of rest. This is contrary to common belief in Christian living where the idea of rest is usually associated with laziness, with the abuse of God’s grace, and busyness is almost always exalted as a virtue. Hence the call to rest, as in the story of Mary and Martha where Jesus praised Mary for choosing the better thing, the resting at his feet, as the better choice that no one can take away from her, becomes a best kept secret, or to some others a heresy that must be banned from pulpits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it shouldn’t be a secret as our Redeemer talked about it often while he was here on earth. He talked about rest, about the setting of the captives free, about living water that satisfies forever, about burden lifted, and about the forgiveness of sin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;its-finished&quot;&gt;It’s finished&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no greater proclamation of the call to rest than what Jesus uttered on the cross at his final moment: &lt;em&gt;“It’s finished!” (John 19:30)&lt;/em&gt;. To the weary and heavily burdened who grew to understand what Jesus meant, this utterance is the split in the curtain that separated them from God, it’s the parting of the Red Sea, it’s the resurrection of the Christ, of the proclamation of the accessibility of the throne of grace, and of practical down-to-earth importance, it’s a huge boulder off their back that they can now stop trying to measure up to God’s impossible standard. Jesus did all that was needed by us to please God, or in other words, Jesus fulfilled all that God required of us to meet his standard of righteousness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are thereby permitted to lay your burden down, to stop trying to be “like God, knowing good and evil” and to start trusting in God who really knows good and evil, who not only knows what good for you to do and what bad for you to avoid but also to give you his creative power to accomplish his will as he has already prepared for you even before you were formed in your mother’s womb. The apostle Paul wrote this of himself that it was God who set him apart from his mother’s womb and called him by his grace to preach the gospel among the Gentiles (Galatians 1:15). What was Paul doing before this calling? Did he earnestly pray that God would call him into ministries? Did he prepare himself for the great task ahead? Did the church lay hands and pray upon him that God would use him mightily? None of the above. On the contrary, he was the enemy of the gospel. God did this to Paul, and to us, so that none among us can claim any credit toward any works of God, so that there would be no doubt in anyone’s mind that God is the author of all good works toward his kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter into God’s rest. It’s the better thing for you to choose and no one can take it away from you. It is the unfinished business with God, the unfinished business with sin and the law, that robs you of the peace, the abundant life, the living water, that Jesus promised you when he invited you to put your trust in him. Trust him. Your business with God, sin, and the law was finished, and Christ made sure of that at Calvary. You are no longer in debt. Come home and rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And they shall teach no more every man his neighbor, and every man his brother, saying, Know the LORD: for they shall all know me, from the least of them to the greatest of them, said the LORD: for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more (Jeremiah 31:34).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grace and peace be with you&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Many are concerned that the unlimitted teaching of grace will cause many to fall into antinomianism, and take advantage of the grace of God and find a license to sin. However Dr. Chalmers, an 18th century theologian, attempts to show us in his writing that such is not a case in the Christian experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://vacsf.org/viet-studies/The-Godspel-Freer-More-Sanctifying-Viet/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Bấm vào đây để đọc tiếng Việt)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dr-chalmers-on-the-gospel&quot;&gt;Dr. Chalmers on the gospel&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Thus it is, that &lt;strong&gt;the freer the Gospel, the more sanctifying&lt;/strong&gt; is the Gospel; and the more it is received as a doctrine of grace, the more will it be felt as a doctrine according to godliness.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This is one of the secrets of the Christian life, that &lt;strong&gt;the more a man holds of God, the greater is the payment of service&lt;/strong&gt; that he renders back again.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;On the tenure of “&lt;strong&gt;Do this and live&lt;/strong&gt;,” a spirit of fearfulness is sure to enter; and the jealousies of a legal bargain chase away all confidence from the intercourse between God and man; and the creature striving to be square and even with his Creator, is, in fact, pursuing all the while his own selfishness, instead of God’s glory; and with all the conformities which he labours to accomplish, the soul of obedience is not there, the mind is not subject to the law of God, nor indeed under such an economy ever can be.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;It is only when, as in the Gospel, acceptance is bestowed as a present, without money, and without price, that the security which man feels in God is placed beyond the reach of disturbance - or, that he can repose in Him, as one friend reposes in another - or, that any liberal and generous understanding can be established betwixt them - the one party rejoicing over the other to do him good - the other finding that the truest gladness of his heart lies in the impulse of a gratitude, by which it is awakened to the charms of a new moral existence.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Salvation by grace - salvation by free grace - salvation not of works, but according to the mercy of God - salvation on such a footing is not more indispensable to the deliverance of our persons from the hand of God’s justice, than it is to the deliverance of our hearts from the chill and the weight of ungodliness.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Retain a single shred or fragment of legality with the Gospel, and we raise a topic of distrust between man and God.  We take away from the power of the Gospel to melt and to conciliate.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;For this purpose, the freer it is, the better it is. That very peculiarity which so many dread as the germ of antinomianism, is, in fact, the germ of a new spirit, and a new inclination against it.  Along with the light of a free Gospel, there enters the love of the Gospel, which, in proportion as we impair the freeness, we are sure to chase away.  And never does the sinner find within himself so mighty a moral transformation, as when he is under the belief that he is saved by grace, for he feels constrained thereby to offer his heart a devoted thing, and to deny ungodliness.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-gospel-the-freer-the-more-sanctifying&quot;&gt;The Gospel, the freer the more sanctifying&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrary to conventional thinking which believes that the preaching of a free gospel will lead to folks finding licence to sin or excuse to abuse God’s grace, Dr Chalmers as well as I believe that a freer gospel will lead to more godliness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;do-this-and-live&quot;&gt;Do this and live&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Old Covenant can be summarized to the concept of “Do this and live,” carefully observing all the commandments written in the book of the law, &lt;em&gt;“Keep[ing] this Book of the Law always on your lips; meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do everything written in it. Then you will be prosperous and successful (Joshua 1:8).”&lt;/em&gt; Ironically the Bible calls this the law of sin and death, and in the same Romans 8:2 passage Paul suggest a new law of the Spirit of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the old law, there is fear, and there is jealousy as one is never certain of God’s acceptance, and in trying to repay God for what He’s done, the person become excessively obsessed toward self instead of God’s glory, and lastly though there is an appearance of obedience, it’s not from the heart, but from fear of punishment. Such is the nature of a “legal bargain” where everything must be earned and paid for. There is always the possibility that your performance is not good enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-more-a-man-holds-of-god-the-greater-the-payment-of-service&quot;&gt;The more a man holds of God, the greater the payment of service&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would probably not go as far as calling the work, that God has prepared beforehand for those who have come to Him by grace and through faith, a payment of service, but even if such a term is used, that God does indeed demand a payment, a man cannot pay more than what he received from God. &lt;em&gt;“The more a man holds of God”&lt;/em&gt;, as Dr Chalmers puts it, means the more he understands the height, depth, and breadth of God’s forgiveness through Christ, the full righteousness that he can be certain of as he puts his trust in Him, the freedom from all condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus, and the all things that God has given him along with His Son, the more he can be an instrument in the hand of God to do the work that is not based on the law, but on faith and purified by grace. In short, the more a man knows his &lt;a href=&quot;http://vacsf.org/articles/The-Will-of-God/&quot;&gt;inheritance in Christ&lt;/a&gt;, the more he can pay, not from the works of his flesh, but from the riches that God had already reserved for him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;acceptance-bestowed-as-a-present&quot;&gt;Acceptance bestowed as a present&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without money, and without price. Only then can there be security and true rest just like a friend is relaxed in the presence of another, and if there is anything the one does for the other, it is from a heart filled with gratitude. This is a new moral existence that is to be desired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;heart-that-knows-its-full-acceptance&quot;&gt;Heart that knows its full acceptance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As important as the truth of salvation by grace, it is of no less importance the deliverance of the heart from the fear and burden of our not being fully accepted by God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;if-there-is-but-a-single-shred-of-legality-with-the-gospel&quot;&gt;If there is but a single shred of legality with the gospel&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The power of the gospel lies in its ability to forgive man and to reconcile them with God, therefore if any amount of legality is implied in the gospel as it is presented, it will take away that power and causes serious distrust between a man and his God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-freer-the-better-is-the-gospel&quot;&gt;The freer the better is the gospel&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Chalmers says it best: “And never does the sinner find within himself so mighty a moral transformation, as when he is under the belief that he is saved by grace, for he feels constrained thereby to offer his heart a devoted thing, and to deny ungodliness.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary type="text">Many are concerned that the unlimitted teaching of grace will cause many to fall into antinomianism, and take advantage of the grace of God and find a license to sin. However Dr. Chalmers, an 18th century theologian, attempts to show us in his writing that such is not a case in the Christian experience.</summary>
