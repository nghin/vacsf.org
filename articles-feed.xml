    &lt;p&gt;In Luke 14 Jesus stated that a tower builder, or a king heading toward a battle, must calculate their chance for success. Yet few who embark on the journey to God’s kingdom ever pay heed to Jesus’ demand for perfection as a prerequisite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;not-one-iota-will-pass&quot;&gt;Not one iota will pass&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://vacsf.org/assets/images/be-ye-perfect-teaser.jpg&quot; style=&quot;border: 1px solid #cccccc; margin: 7px 15px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 148px; padding: 0px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Matthew 5:18, Jesus spoke in no uncertain term that &lt;em&gt;“… Until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished. (NIV)”&lt;/em&gt; And then he followed suit with a law that should strike fear in the heart of all those who aim to enter the kingdom of God:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect. (Matthew 5:48 - KJV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet many Christians seem oblivious to its implication. Countless books and sermons were written and preached in the hope of moving the believers to a higher level of spirituality while ignoring its obvious futility. Most Bible commentaries are no exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea of man’s self bootstrap toward godhood is the main feature of all the world’s religions. Repeated incarnations and various forms of self-denials are proposed as a means for breaking free from the cycle of birth and death by overcoming the sinful flesh. For the Christians, it’s some good things they must do or some bad things they must avoid to improve their relationship with God and to have better assurance of their salvation. Most believe their life is a work in progress. They call it the process of sanctification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this respect, those who believe in reincarnations fare better as they believe one day they will reach their goal of perfection albeit through an infinite number of trials. But what about the Christians? They have only one chance to get to perfection before they meet God as it is written in 2 Corinthians 5:10: &lt;em&gt;“For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, …”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-young-ruler&quot;&gt;The young ruler&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Matthew 19, we read of a rich young ruler who came to meet Jesus asking him what good things he must do to inherit the kingdom of God, and he got the following answer from the Author of the Law:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me . (Matthew 19:21)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This young man boasted that he was able to keep all the commandments Jesus asked. But this one thing that wasn’t clearly spelled out in the written law took him by surprise: &lt;em&gt;“sell your possessions and give to the poor.”&lt;/em&gt; Jesus knew how to humble a man, especially one who is religious. No matter how a man tries to cover himself with the fig leaves of his righteous acts, the Bible clearly describes his true condition:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God (Romans 3:23)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like many modern Christians, the young ruler thought he could achieve perfection through good deeds, but Jesus knew better, for he himself inspired the prophet Isaiah to declare since ancient time that all man’s &lt;em&gt;“righteous acts are like filthy rags (Isaiah 64:6)”&lt;/em&gt; which can never restore fallen man to their lost glory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, though Jesus said people must become perfect before they can enter the kingdom of God, his true intention was to inform humanity that perfection belongs to God alone and he will never share his glory with flesh and blood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;an-honest-assessment&quot;&gt;An honest assessment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are among those who follow the path of progressive sanctification, what is your self-assessment of where you stand along the perfection scale? Have you made much progress since the day you called Jesus your Savior and Lord? How many years do you think it will be before you meet the Lord? At the current rate of progress, where do you think you will be? What if you are to meet him tonight? Will you be perfect enough to enter his heaven?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are a teacher who is teaching others this progressive sanctification, what is your rate of success? And even more importantly, what is your very own self-assessment? A pastor likens the effort to rid one’s self of his sin nature to the attempt to jump to the moon. Using this analogy, we might ask: how can a man who has never succeeded in his effort to jump to the moon presume to teach others how to achieve such feat?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trying your best will not be good enough, and neither will the discounting of Jesus’ insistence in his demand for perfection. Jesus absolutely meant it when he said not a stroke of a pen will be removed from the law. There should be no doubt in anyone’s mind that they must be completely flawless on or before the day of reckoning:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“… holiness, without which no man shall see God.” (Hebrews 12:14)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-quick-detour-sanctification&quot;&gt;A quick detour: sanctification&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The theological definition of sanctification is to set apart something for particular use as intended by the designer. However, in practice, the word usually takes on a much different meaning. It’s usually used to include purity, holiness, morality, virtue, etc. Most Bible teachers promote a concept called progressive sanctification, a process in which a Christian must strive to become more and more sanctified until he or she reaches perfection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we’re on this topic, let us take an honest look at our own progress and ask ourselves: Am I becoming more like my Savior as each day goes by? More love? More patience? Slower to anger? A student needs only take an exam to learn with a fair degree of accuracy his current standing as well as progress since the last test. It’s not clear how we can do this with our spiritual life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many years ago, I and my wife spent a couple of hours on one Saturday by signing up for some classes to learn some skills. My wife took baking while I took a voice lesson. After listening to the instructor for about two hours, I left the hotel conference room without any idea how to improve my singing voice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning how to sing is as nothing compared to trying to imitate Christ. Yet the chances I’ll be singing like Pavarotti are slim to none in this lifetime. Hence even slimmer, by comparison, must be the chances for becoming like my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. A man may be able to acquire the skills that make angels envious, but for him to become like God? Not only that it’s an impossible pursuit, but he is also repeating the original sin of trying to become like God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea of progressive sanctification is such a deception that robs believers of the joy of salvation, and along with it the true Sabbath rest that is rightfully theirs that no one should take away. Besides, what part of you needs to be sanctified? Spirit? No, the Spirit came from God, the same One that was breathed into Adam to give him life, and the same One that is once again breathed into those who came into a trust relationship with God through Christ. Can you really improve the Holy Spirit? The third Person of the Godhead? Absolutely not. What about Body, or Soul, or Flesh, the non-spirit part of a person? Where does the Bible say the mortal flesh will ever enter the kingdom of God (1 Corinthians 15:50)? Nowhere, except in 1 Corinthians 15:52 where Paul tells us a mystery, that in a flash, in the twinkling of an eye, when we will be clothed with immortality. This change to immortality, to perfection, is not progressive, but instantaneous, and it will only happen when Christ comes again. Additionally, the progressive sanctification idea smacks of trying to patch up an old piece of garment, our present flesh, with the new cloth of the gospel. At the end of this writing, we will take a quick tour through Galatians 3 to view through biblical lenses the true meaning of perfection and sanctification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;gods-will-for-your-life&quot;&gt;God’s will for your life&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people think God’s will is his desires or expectations for them. Perhaps he wants them to overcome some sins or character flaws, or to call them into some ministries or certain other things among countless things a believer must do in order to bring themselves closer to where they think their God wants them to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such a view of God’s will is a recipe for a miserable Christian life as there will be no rest for the soul who has to constantly make guesses and chase after their perceived will of God. A question that might be raised is will they ever arrive at a state of resolution before they meet their Maker?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe the true will of God is the description of the indescribable inheritance that is sealed by the blood of the Lamb of God for you in the heavenly places. And if he does have a desire for you while you’re still here on earth, it must be this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;… make every effort to enter that rest (Hebrews 4:11)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you see the significance of this verse? God gave us many foreshadows of rest only to point to the ultimate rest from the work of restoring man’s fellowship with God. The Sabbath gave the Israelite physical rest, but it points to our spiritual rest. Jesus spoke often of the rest of those who were heavily burdened, but not at all of the physical burden that must be borne by all of earth dwellers. He talked of the spiritual burden that is borne of a life trying to get right with God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the final moment on the cross, Jesus spoke: &lt;em&gt;“It’s finished.”&lt;/em&gt; The work of restoring the perfect status of man before God was finished. It was done, some two thousand years ago. Anyone who accepts his finished work and rest in it, will enter into his peace. But unfortunately, most Christians refuse to enter this rest, much like the Israelite of old who refused to enter the promised land upon their first arrival and ended up going in circles for the next 40 years. This rest is so important that the author of Hebrews calls their refusal to enter the promised land the rebellion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;So, as the Holy Spirit says: “Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts as you did in &lt;strong&gt;the rebellion&lt;/strong&gt;, during the time of testing in the wilderness, where your ancestors tested and tried me, though for forty years they saw what I did. That is why I was angry with that generation; I said, ‘Their hearts are always going astray, and &lt;strong&gt;they have not known my ways&lt;/strong&gt;.’ So I declared on oath in my anger, ‘&lt;strong&gt;They shall never enter my rest&lt;/strong&gt;.’ ” (Hebrews 3:7-11)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rebellion was the refusal to enter the promised land, the place that the Lord called his REST, the place where the work of redeeming man was finished. God’s &lt;em&gt;“ways”&lt;/em&gt; is the way of trusting in what Christ had done, not the way of the works of the flesh, or the reliance on obedience to the law to earn righteousness. So God unloaded his wrath against those who rejected his free gift of salvation and declined to enter his rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This theme of God’s anger against those who refuse to walk by grace is further amplified in the Galatians letter that we will delve into a bit later. Here, let us be reminded once again that God’s utmost desire for us is we fully enter that place of rest, or rather to fully understand God’s grace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. (2 Peter 3:18)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;galatians-3--faith-or-works-of-the-law&quot;&gt;Galatians 3 — Faith or Works of the Law?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four years have passed since I first wrote a study on &lt;a href=&quot;https://vacsf.org/galatians/Galatians-Chapter-03/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Galatians 3&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; around the middle of 2015. I have grown much in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ (2 Peter 3:18) since then. This second writing is used to provide further context to help discover Jesus’ true intention in his almost parabolic command: &lt;em&gt;“Be Ye Perfect.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let us delve into Galatians 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;galatians-31-4&quot;&gt;Galatians 3:1-4&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;You foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you? Before your very eyes Jesus Christ was clearly portrayed as crucified. &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;I would like to learn just one thing from you: Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law,or by believing what you heard? &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Are you so foolish? After beginning by means of the Spirit, are you now trying to finish by means of the flesh? &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;Have you experienced so much in vain—if it really was in vain?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever the Galatians were doing, they acted as if Jesus wasn’t crucified. Because if they believed that he was, they would have lived out their Christian life differently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul began by asking the Galatians how they became Christians, whether through believing the gospel message they heard or through obedience to the rules spelled out in the law. Paul contrasted the two means they might have employed toward salvation, and it was clear he expected them to give the right answer that faith, or believing, was the only means acceptable to God. Then he followed up with a rebuke of the way they chose to live out the rest of their Christian life. They relied on human efforts, on the strength of their flesh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note the word &lt;em&gt;“finish”&lt;/em&gt; Paul used in the rebuke. Some other translations use the words &lt;em&gt;“made perfect”&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;“made complete.”&lt;/em&gt; Paul knew the Galatians didn’t trust in the finished work of Christ, so in their mind, they were not yet perfect even though Christ had died for them once for all. This is the same error that is still being committed to this present day. All you need to do is search the internet for “progressive sanctification” to find the same idea being propagated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;galatians-35-6&quot;&gt;Galatians 3:5-6&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;So again I ask, does God give you his Spirit and work miracles among you by the works of the law, or by your believing what you heard? &lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;So also Abraham “believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul reiterated what he wrote in verses 1-4 that righteousness is through faith alone, and all that Abraham needed was faith in God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;galatians-37-9&quot;&gt;Galatians 3:7-9&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;Understand, then, that those who have faith are children of Abraham. &lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;Scripture foresaw that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, and announced the gospel in advance to Abraham: “All nations will be blessed through you.” &lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;So those who rely on faith are blessed along with Abraham, the man of faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you read these verses, keep in mind that Paul was emphasizing faith as opposed to the works of the law, and he keeps repeating it ad nauseam to impress upon us its importance. The true children of Abraham are those who rely on faith and are also those not necessarily related to him by blood, namely the Gentiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;galatians-310-14&quot;&gt;Galatians 3:10-14&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;For all who rely on the works of the law are under a curse, as it is written: “Cursed is everyone who does not continue to do everything written in the Book of the Law.” &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;Clearly no one who relies on the law is justified before God, because “the righteous will live by faith.” &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;The law is not based on faith; on the contrary, it says, “The person who does these things will live by them.”&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us, for it is written: “Cursed is everyone who is hung on a pole.” &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;He redeemed us in order that the blessing given to Abraham might come to the Gentiles through Christ Jesus, so that by faith we might receive the promise of the Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is really no need to explain the meaning of these verses. They speak for themselves. But let’s go through the main points for more clarity. What does it mean to &lt;em&gt;“rely on the law?”&lt;/em&gt; Religious people rely on the law, or the keeping of the law’s requirements, to get right with God. But as we read from verse 11, the works of the law will NOT get anyone &lt;em&gt;“justified before God.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verse 12 says &lt;em&gt;“The law is not based on faith.”&lt;/em&gt; It is so because it requires works for justification, and that can’t happen as it is so stated in verse 11. Faith is based on an object external to one’s self, namely Jesus Christ and all that he’s done, on the contrary, the law is based on the performance of the flesh. One puts the focus on Christ while the other back on self.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, the law is truly a curse to those who rely on it. It’s a curse because there is no rest for those who must &lt;em&gt;“continue to do everything written in the Book of the Law.”&lt;/em&gt; They must continue because the works of the law will not get them to their destination. These works are much like the repeated offering of sacrifices of the old covenant that could not take away sins (Hebrews 10:1-4).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verse 12: &lt;em&gt;“The person who does these things will live by them.”&lt;/em&gt; These things are the works of the law, therefore, those who rely on the law will have to meet the exact requirements of the law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verse 13: &lt;em&gt;“Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us.”&lt;/em&gt; Christians have often been taught that obedience to the law is essential for spiritual growth, but verse 13 refers to the law as a curse and that Christ has redeemed us from it. The Bible clearly gives us permission to live apart from the law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, verse 14: &lt;em&gt;“by faith we might receive the promise of the Spirit.”&lt;/em&gt; To receive the Spirit is to be given eternal life. This verse places great significance on how the Spirit is received: by faith, not by the works of the law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, if none of the good deeds can get one into heaven, how can there be any action that makes one more acceptable to God as proposed by the progressive sanctification proponents?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;galatians-323-26&quot;&gt;Galatians 3:23-26&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;Before the coming of this faith, we were held in custody under the law, locked up until the faith that was to come would be revealed. &lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;So the law was our guardian until Christ came that we might be justified by faith. &lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt;Now that this faith has come, we are no longer under a guardian. &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;So in Christ Jesus you are all children of God through faith, 27 for all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verse 23: &lt;em&gt;“Before the coming of this faith.”&lt;/em&gt; This faith is the faith that says &lt;em&gt;“Believe in the One God has sent and you shall be saved (John 6:29),”&lt;/em&gt; and not the faith that places confidence in human effort.  We were under the law only until the arrival of the faith that saves. The law was our &lt;em&gt;“guardian”&lt;/em&gt; only temporarily until Christ comes. And Paul repeated it again: we became children of God &lt;em&gt;“through faith.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;be-ye-perfect&quot;&gt;Be Ye Perfect&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To receive the Holy Spirit means to receive everlasting life, to once again receive the Life that was infused into Adam when God created the world. However, in order for God to indwell your heart, one condition must have been met: you’re perfect. But are you? No, you’re not, for &lt;em&gt;“All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God (Romans 3:23),”&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;“None is righteous, no, not one (Romans 3:10),”&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;“all our righteous acts are like filthy rags (Isaiah 64:6).”&lt;/em&gt; So, how have you become so pure and sanctified that God could take residence in your heart? Because we all are &lt;em&gt;“justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus (Romans 3:24).”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are perfect because we have been justified, and it is by grace through faith, and not by even the best of our righteous acts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-truth-shall-set-you-free&quot;&gt;The truth shall set you free&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The truth about our justification sets us free so we may truly know God. There is no more fear of condemnation that keeps us in hiding, while God’s complete acceptance allows us to boldly walk into the light of his presence so we can fellowship with him. There is no more need to measure up, to scale the impossible wall of perfection, but there is “rest beyond the river” as the song goes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The perpetual quest of man to reach perfection through their own flesh effort proves but one thing: their pride, because where there is work, there is pride and boasting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Where, then, is boasting? It is excluded. Because of what law? The law that requires works? No, because of the law that requires faith. (Romans 3:27)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, then lies the cure for the incurable perfectionist: Christ has already made you perfect through his redemption on the cross. Christ has set you free so you may know him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the Be-Ye-Perfect command, or any among the Ten Commandments, or any command that has dwelled in man’s conscience since they acquired the knowledge of good and evil in the garden of Eden, must be fulfilled by candidates for the kingdom of God, no one will enter it. Don’t even try, and don’t teach others to do what you can’t do. Jesus gave the command &lt;em&gt;“Be Ye Perfect”&lt;/em&gt;, and many others like it in the Old Covenant context, only to show man’s utter helplessness and their need for God’s grace and mercies. He wanted to nudge them toward a New Covenant relationship with him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body that is subject to death? &lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt;Thanks be to God, who delivers me through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, I myself in my mind am a slave to God’s law, but in my sinful nature a slave to the law of sin. (Romans 7:24-25—NIV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perfection is God’s domain. Do not trespass.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Is the path narrow because of the difficulty or sacrifice it asks of its followers? Or it is only so because of the very narrowness of its definition? &lt;i&gt;(Phải chăng đường hẹp vì những khó khăn và hy sinh mà người theo phải chịu? Hoặc chỉ là hẹp về định nghĩa của nó?)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An article under the same title was written by me, Nghi Nguyen, around the end of 2016, but this one is actually written by Ngô Vui who by the grace of God had come onto the same path to explore the incredible inheritance reserved for those who are in Christ. Enjoy. &lt;em&gt;(Tôi, Nghị Nguyễn, đã viết một bài với cùng tựa đề vào khoảng cuối năm 2016, nhưng bài này đã được viết bởi anh Ngô Vui, người mà bởi ân điển Chúa đã trở nên bạn đồng hành để khám phá cơ nghiệp diệu kỳ mà Chúa đã dành sẵn cho những kẻ ở trong Ngài. Xin mời bạn đọc cùng thưởng thức)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-narrow-path---con-Đường-hẹp&quot;&gt;The Narrow Path - &lt;em&gt;Con Đường Hẹp&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus said: “Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free &lt;em&gt;( Chúa Giê-su phán: Khi các ngươi hiểu được sự thật, thì sự thật sẽ giải phóng các ngươi - John 8:32)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before Jesus went on the cross, he spent 3 years to explain to the Israelites the true purpose of God’s law. For example, when he said &lt;em&gt;(Trước khi lên thập tự, Chúa Giê-su đã tốn 3 năm với người Do-thái để làm sáng tỏ ý nghĩa của luật pháp Đức Chúa Trời. Ví dụ khi Ngài phán)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You have heard that it was said to the people long ago, ‘You shall not murder, and anyone who murders will be subject to judgment.’ But I tell you that anyone who is angry with a brother or sister will be subject to judgment &lt;em&gt;(Luật pháp Môi-se dạy chớ giết người, nhưng ta bảo các ngươi nếu ai ghét anh em mình thì đã phạm tội ấy - Matthew 5:21 -22)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;You have heard that it was said, ‘Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’  But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you &lt;em&gt;(Các ngươi có nghe lời phán rằng: Hãy yêu bạn, ghét thù. Nhưng ta bảo các ngươi hãy yêu kẻ thù nghịch, và cầu nguyện cho kẻ bắt bớ các ngươi - Matthew 5:43-44)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Do not judge, or you too will be judged &lt;em&gt;(Đừng đoán xét người khác, để khỏi bị đoán xét - Matthew 7:1)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Do to others as you would have them do to you &lt;em&gt;(Các ngươi muốn người ta làm cho mình thể nào, hãy làm cho người ta thể ấy - Luke 6:31)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect &lt;em&gt;(Các ngươi hãy nên trọn vẹn, như Cha các ngươi ở trên trời là trọn vẹn - Matthew 5:48)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And many other things in the similar vein which forces the hearers to ponder within themselves: Who can escape sins? &lt;em&gt;(Và Ngài cũng phán nhiều điều khác nữa, khiến người nghe không khỏi tự hỏi trong lòng mình: Vậy thì ai thoát được tội?)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surely, from the beginning of time, mankind knew that God’s law was good and holy. But they consistently failed in all their efforts to reach perfection; efforts that were based on obedience to the requirements of the law &lt;em&gt;(Thật vậy, từ buổi ban đầu, nhân loại vốn nhận biết luật pháp Đức Chúa Trời là thiêng liêng và tốt lành. Thế nhưng, họ luôn luôn thất bại trong những nỗ lực đạt đến sự toàn thiện, những nỗ lực đặt nền tảng trên sự làm trọn các sự đòi hỏi của luật pháp)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God already knew this since before creation. Therefore, He preordained a way to lead man to eternal life, a way that Jesus called “the narrow path” &lt;em&gt;(Chúa đã biết điều này từ trước khi sáng thế. Do đó, Ngài đã sắm sẵn một con đường đưa nhân loại đến sự sống đời đời,  con đường mà Ngài gọi là “hẹp” - Matthew 7:13-14)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do Scriptures say about “The Narrow Path?” &lt;em&gt;(Kinh thánh nói gì về “Con Đường Hẹp?”)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, and through whom also he made the universe &lt;em&gt;(Bởi Con [là Chúa Giê-su] mà Đức Chúa Trời đã lập nên thế gian, và Con là Đấng kế tự muôn vật - Hebrews 1:2)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;For just as through the disobedience of the one man [Adam] the many were made sinners, so also through the obedience of the one man [Jesus Christ]the many will be made righteous &lt;em&gt;(Bởi một người [là A-đam] không vâng phục mà &lt;u&gt;cả nhân loại đã bị kết tội&lt;/u&gt; thể nào, thì cũng bởi một người [là Chúa Giê-su] đã vâng phục trọn vẹn mà sự hòa thuận giữa Đức Chúa Trời với &lt;u&gt;những kẻ tin&lt;/u&gt; để được xưng công bình cũng như thể ấy - Romans 5:19)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;He was chosen before the creation of the world, but was revealed in these last times for your sake &lt;em&gt;(Trước khi sáng tạo vũ trụ, Thượng Đế đã dành sẵn Con Ngài cho mục đích ấy; nhưng đến thời kỳ chúng ta, Chúa Giê-su mới xuất hiện để thực thi chương trình cứu rỗi anh em - 1 Peter 1:20)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Where, then, is boasting? It is excluded. Because of what law? The law that requires works? No, because of the law that requires faith. For we maintain that a person is justified by faith apart from the works of the law &lt;em&gt;(Vậy thì sự khoe mình ở đâu? Bởi luật pháp của việc làm chăng? Không phải, nhưng bởi luật của đức tin. Vì người ta chỉ được xưng công bình bởi đức tin - Romans 3:27-28)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question&lt;/strong&gt;: What then is the purpose of the law? &lt;em&gt;(Hỏi: Vậy thì mục đích của luật pháp là gì?)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is written&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Kinh thánh viết)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Now we know that whatever the law says, it says to those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be silenced and the whole world held accountable to God. Therefore no one will be declared righteous in God’s sight by the works of the law; rather, through the law we become conscious of our sin &lt;em&gt;(Kinh thánh viết:  Vả, chúng ta biết rằng những điều mà luật pháp nói, là nói cho mọi kẻ ở dưới luật pháp, hầu cho miệng nào cũng phải ngậm lại, cả thiên hạ đều nhận tội trước mặt Đức Chúa Trời; vì chẳng có một người nào bởi việc làm theo luật pháp mà sẽ được xưng công bình trước mặt Ngài, vì luật pháp cho người ta biết tội lỗi. - Romans 3:19-20)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question&lt;/strong&gt;: Who are under the law? &lt;strong&gt;Answer&lt;/strong&gt;: Everyone, those who have not accepted Christ as their Savior &lt;em&gt;(Hỏi: Ai là những kẻ ở dưới luật pháp? Trả lời: Cả thế gian, tất cả những người chưa tin nhận Chúa Giê-su là Cứu Chúa)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question&lt;/strong&gt;: What role then does the law play in the life of believers? &lt;em&gt;(Hỏi: Vậy luật pháp đóng vai trò gì  trong đời sống những kẻ tin?)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is written&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Kinh thánh viết)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Before the coming of this faith, we were held in custody under the law, locked up until the faith that was to come would be revealed &lt;em&gt;(Trước khi đức tin chưa đến, chúng ta bị nhốt dưới sự canh giữ của luật pháp mà chờ đức tin phải bày ra - Galatians 3:23)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;So the law was our guardian until Christ came that we might be justified by faith &lt;em&gt;(Ấy vậy, luật pháp đã như thầy giáo đặng dẫn chúng ta đến Đấng Christ, hầu cho chúng ta bởi đức tin mà được xưng công bình. - Galatians 3:24)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Now that this faith has come, we are no longer under a guardian &lt;em&gt;(Song khi đức tin đã đến, chúng ta không còn phục dưới thầy giáo ấy nữa - Galatians 3:25)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;But now, by dying to what once bound us, we have been released from the law so that we serve in the new way of the Spirit, and not in the old way of the written code &lt;em&gt;(Nhưng bây giờ chúng ta đã chết về luật-pháp, là điều bắt buộc mình, thì được buông tha khỏi luật-pháp đặng hầu việc Ðức Chúa Trời theo cách mới của Thánh Linh, chớ không theo cách cũ của văn tự - Romans 7:6)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Hỏi)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What shall we say, then? Shall we go on sinning so that grace may increase? &lt;em&gt;(Vậy chúng ta sẽ nói làm sao? Chúng ta phải cứ ở trong tội lỗi, hầu cho ân điển được dư dật chăng? - Romans 6:1)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Answer&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Trả lời)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;By no means! We are those who have died to sin; how can we live in it any longer? &lt;em&gt;(Chẳng hề như vậy! Chúng ta đã chết về tội lỗi, lẽ nào còn sống trong tội lỗi nữa? - Romans 6:2)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;For sin shall no longer be your master, because you are not under the law, but under grace &lt;em&gt;(Vì tội lỗi không cai trị trên anh em đâu; bởi anh em chẳng thuộc dưới luật pháp, mà thuộc dưới ân điển - Romans 6:14)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“For through the law I died to the law so that I might live for God. I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. The life I now live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me &lt;em&gt;(Vả, bởi luật pháp, tôi đã chết cho luật pháp, để sống cho Đức Chúa Trời. Tôi đã bị đóng đinh vào thập tự giá với Đấng Christ, mà tôi sống, không phải là tôi sống nữa, nhưng Đấng Christ sống trong tôi; nay tôi còn sống trong xác thịt, ấy là tôi sống trong đức tin của Con Đức Chúa Trời, là Đấng đã yêu tôi, và đã phó chính mình Ngài vì tôi - Galatians 2:19-20)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I do not set aside the grace of God, for if righteousness could be gained through the law, Christ died for nothing &lt;em&gt;(Tôi không muốn làm cho ân điển Đức Chúa Trời ra vô ích; vì nếu bởi luật pháp mà được sự công bình, thì Đấng Christ chịu chết là vô ích - Galatians 2:21)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;And if by grace, then it cannot be based on works; if it were, grace would no longer be grace &lt;em&gt;(Nhưng nếu bởi ơn thì chẳng phải bởi việc làm nữa; bằng chẳng, thì ơn không còn phải là ơn - Romans 11:6)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question&lt;/strong&gt; How does reliance on obedience to the law affect one’s faith in God? &lt;em&gt;(Hỏi: Sự nương cậy vào luật pháp có ảnh hưởng gì đến đức tin?)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is written&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Kinh thánh viết)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You who are trying to be justified by the law have been alienated from Christ; you have fallen away from grace &lt;em&gt;(Một khi anh em muốn nhờ luật pháp để được cứu rỗi, anh em đã tự ly khai với Đấng Christ và đánh mất ân điển của Thượng Đế - Galatians 5:4)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;in-conclusion---kết-luận&quot;&gt;In conclusion - &lt;em&gt;Kết luận&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The narrow path that Jesus spoke of is the path of faith apart from the law &lt;em&gt;(Con đường hẹp mà Chúa Giê-su nói đến là con đường của đức tin không lệ thuộc vào luật pháp)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Therefore no one will be declared righteous in God’s sight by the works of the law; rather, through the law we become conscious of our sin. But now apart from the law the righteousness of God has been made known, to which the Law and the Prophets testify. This righteousness is given through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe &lt;em&gt;(Sự công bình của Đức Chúa Trời được bày tỏ ra ngoài luật pháp cho mọi kẻ tin. Vì chẳng có việc làm nào theo luật pháp mà được xưng công bình trước mặt Đức Chúa Trời - Romans 3:20 -22)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, it should become clear what God wants to convey to us through Paul. May God’s grace always be your greatest blessings &lt;em&gt;(Đến đây, chắc chắn chúng ta phải được sáng tỏ về điều Chúa muốn truyền đạt cho chúng ta qua Phao-lô. Nguyền xin ân điển Chúa mãi luôn là nguồn phước lớn nhất cho các bạn đọc)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ngô Vui&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Christians are often taught to look to Jesus as an ideal role model to follow in his footsteps, to grow more like him. Do key Scriptural precepts suggest this is how Christians are to live out their faith? Let’s find out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;learning-from-the-best&quot;&gt;Learning from the best&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://vacsf.org/assets/images/walk-like-jesus-did-teaser.jpg&quot; style=&quot;border: 1px solid #cccccc; margin: 7px 15px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 148px; padding: 0px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shortly after I became a Christian, “The Immitation of Christ” by Thomas A. Kempis became my first guide on Christian living. Then one day I received a stack of bookmarks with each having the title “Walk Like Jesus Did.” A quick glance through it told me I had something great to write about. The bookmark suggests 5 ways in which we can imitate Christ. Let us tackle them one by one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-student-of-scriptures&quot;&gt;1. Student of Scriptures&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;luke-246&quot;&gt;Luke 2:46&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;After three days they found him in the temple courts, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing in this verse indicates that Jesus went to the temple court to learn Scriptures. It’s absurd to think that the author of the Word went to the temple court to learn about Himself. An absurdity that I used to subscribe to without ever questioning. Jesus came to the temple court not to be a student but to be a teacher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;matthew-4447410&quot;&gt;Matthew 4:4,4:7,4:10&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;But he answered, “It is written, ‘Man does not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.’”
&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;Jesus said to him, “Once again it is written: ‘You are not to put the Lord your God to the test.’”
&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;Then Jesus said to him, “Go away, Satan! For it is written: ‘You are to worship the Lord your God and serve only him.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can come to the same conclusion about all the verses above. They convey nothing about Jesus being a student of Scriptures. Why do people keep thinking that Jesus needs to learn like a common man? From one side of their mouth they teach that Jesus is omniscient, and from the other they teach that he is as ignorant as a lost sinner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-yielded-to-gods-will&quot;&gt;2. Yielded to God’s Will&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;luke-2242&quot;&gt;Luke 22:42&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Father, if you are willing, take this cup away from me. Yet not my will but yours be done.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;matthew-610&quot;&gt;Matthew 6:10&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;May your kingdom come, and your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus’ motivation to yield to the Father’s will is nothing like ours. We yield because of a sense of being compelled to, or because someone tells us that we should, or other external factors. But this is not true with Jesus. He does not suffer from fear, threat, or insecurities as he suffers no consequences of sins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2-kings-514&quot;&gt;2 Kings 5:14&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;So he went down and dipped in the Jordan seven times, as the prophet had instructed. His skin became as smooth as a young child’s and he was healed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the context of the passage we know that Naaman did not yield to God’s will out of his own willingness. He followed the direction to dip himself in the river as a last resort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-god-pleasing-choices&quot;&gt;3. God Pleasing Choices&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;john-829&quot;&gt;John 8:29&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And the one who sent me is with me. He has not left me alone, because I always do those things that please him.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;john-434&quot;&gt;John 4:34&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Jesus said to them, “My food is to do the will of the one who sent me and to complete his work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is foolish to think that Jesus has to make a choice between to do or not to do the Father’s will. It is not in his divine nature to make such choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1-john-26b&quot;&gt;1 John 2:6b&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The one who says he resides in God ought himself to walk just as Jesus walked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This whole article is to refute the idea of imitating Christ. Let’s defer it until the conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;4-humble-servant-attitude&quot;&gt;4. Humble Servant Attitude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;philippians-27-8&quot;&gt;Philippians 2:7-8&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;but emptied himself by taking on the form of a slave, by looking like other men, and by sharing in human nature. He humbled himself, by becoming obedient to the point of death – even death on a cross!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;john-135&quot;&gt;John 13:5&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;He poured water into the washbasin and began to wash the disciples’ feet andto dry them with the towel he had wrapped around himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus has no problem humbling himself for at least two reasons. One is he doesn’t lack in self-esteem so in him there is no craving for honor or recognition. And two, his supreme greatness stands unchallenged by anyone or anything in creation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When one performs an act of humble service, there is an expectation of a personal sacrifice. But Jesus doesn’t have to give up anything as there is nothing in him that anyone can rob away. His divinity remains intact. He’s never insecure, and he will never be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can we say the same thing of fallen humanity? We face a never-ending struggle with our flesh which will always insist on its own glory. We can never ask a selfish thing to perform a selfless act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;5-practiced-forgiveness&quot;&gt;5. Practiced Forgiveness&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;luke-2334&quot;&gt;Luke 23:34&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But Jesus said, “Father, forgive them, for they don’t know what they are doing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no doubt Jesus forgave those who had committed unspeakable acts against him, but this does not imply this is what we must or have the ability to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;matthew-612&quot;&gt;Matthew 6:12&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;and forgive us our debts, as we ourselves have forgiven our debtors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;acts-759-60&quot;&gt;Acts 7:59-60&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;They continued to stone Stephen while he prayed, “Lord Jesus, receive my spirit!” Then he fell to his knees and cried out with a loud voice, “Lord, do not hold this sin against them!” When he had said this, he died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To forgive, one’s heart must have more love than required. Jesus is God, and God is the very essence of love. People hold grudges  because there are places in their heart that still hurt. For this reason, to ask people to forgive like Jesus is to ask them to give what they do not have. But instead, teach them to fill their heart with God’s love and forgiveness. Then they will be able to forgive from their full hearts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus being Love himself is more than capable to forgive as he did. And more than just forgiving those who crucified him, he forgave the whole world. As for Stephen, there is no doubt having been filled with the Holy Spirit and seen the heavens opened, he must have been in the right frame of mind. We cannot expect this in the daily circumstances of Christian living.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;in-conclusion&quot;&gt;In conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s review the various things we learn about Jesus. He is God. He is a sinless man. He can forgive sins with the kind of forgiveness that can bridge the gap between God and Man. He can raise the dead. He can heal the sick, those with the kind of sickness that only the Messiah can heal. Such sickness as leprosy, blindness since birth, or other severe illness. He made enough food from a few man’s lunch to feed thousands. He died on the cross to carry the weight of the sins of the world. He rose from the dead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The premise of the bookmark is: “The one who says he resides in God ought himself to walk just as Jesus walked.” Can you walk just as he did? Why pick and choose only from those in the bookmark? Those that seem to be within their grasp yet are still impossible to fallen Man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For the flesh has desires that are opposed to the Spirit, and the Spirit has desires that are opposed to the flesh, for these are in opposition to each other, so that you cannot do what you want. (Galatians 5:17)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To ask Christians to do what only Christ can do is to hold them captive for a lifetime of frustration. Their belief in eternal security will always be on shaky ground. Frequent tripping over the high bar of imitating Christ creates doubt nonetheless. This sort of teaching takes the believer’s eyes off of Christ. They may start out studying Christ, but eventually, their eyes will return to themselves. That is what the law does. Faith focuses one’s eyes upon Christ, but the law draws them toward self.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We would do well to view virtues promoted by the bookmark as the fruit of the Spirit which can only be born from above. Fruits imply the person from whom they came had no prior knowledge of their appearance. The more they focus upon their fruit, the more failure they will experience, but if they fix their eyes on Christ, it will be God who will bear fruit in them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trust God afresh each day and make every effort to rest in him (Hebrews 4:11). If the master molder decides to add a feature to his clay masterpiece, who are we to interfere with him? Be surprised as he bears fruit in your life, and stop trying.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A popular call to backsliding believers to wake up from their slumber and bear fruit for Christ. Is the call a one time transition from death to life, or a never-ending struggle to maintain an acceptable state of wakefulness, and fruitfulness?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;not-applicable&quot;&gt;Not applicable&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://vacsf.org/assets/images/awake-o-sleeper-teaser.jpg&quot; style=&quot;border: 1px solid #cccccc; margin: 7px 15px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 148px; padding: 0px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;
Ephesians 5:14, which is a direct quote of Isaiah 51:17: &lt;em&gt;“Awake, O sleeper! Rise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you!”&lt;/em&gt;, is commonly used to issue the call to nudge believers from their status quo. However, a question that must be raised is: Should this verse be applied to believers, or only to those who are still apart from God? In fact, this article will show that the verse should not be used in any context including either for evangelism or for edification in the body of Christ, for the reason that it’s not meant for such purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;for-evangelism&quot;&gt;For evangelism?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In John 11:1-44 where Jesus raised Lazarus from the dead, he spoke: &lt;em&gt;“Lazarus, come forth.”&lt;/em&gt; Do you think Jesus waited for Lazarus to hear his call and to make a decision whether he should come out or not? There is no way a man who had been dead for four days would be able to hear the call and walk out of his tomb. It was more for the observers around him at that time, Lazarus’ sister Martha and perhaps others who were present there to know what was about to take place, a miracle that they had never seen before, a demonstration of the power of God, and ultimately the announcement of the coming of a new era, the introduction of the New Covenant between God and Man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore it can be asserted that this verse, Isaiah 51:17, cannot be used for evangelistic purposes, neither should it be used to wake those who are already alive in Christ. For all practical intents and purposes, it’s an announcement of what is to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;for-sanctification&quot;&gt;For sanctification?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What can be the application of Isaiah 51:17 to believers? To wake them up from their spiritual lethargy? Even assuming that it is scripturally correct to do so, what is the success rate? Practically zero in my experience. But it’s not even scripturally correct as the attempt to apply this verse to believers assums a theology that believers, at least most of them, are still dead, which means Christ’s death on the cross was in vain, that they’re still in their sins (1 Corinthians 15:17).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;its-a-prophecy&quot;&gt;It’s a prophecy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isaiah 51:17 is a prophecy of what Christ will bring through the cross, a new life of the indwelling Spirit of God that was lost in Adam but will be given to those that believe. Just as God gave his Spirit, his breath, that brought a lump of clay to rise up to become the first man in creation, so will he give to spiritually dead man the life they need. It’s not a call to dead man that they may come alive, not a call to spur carnal believers toward spiritual productivity, but a promise of a new and living way to God through Christ’s body on the cross.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;more-than-conquerors&quot;&gt;More than conquerors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we’re more than conquerors according to Romans 8:37, how can it be that someone is trying to call us from the dead? It doesn’t make any sense, does it? We also know that we’re conquerors in the sense that Christ had overcome sins for us, he had changed our status from condemned sinners to children of God, he had blotted all our sins and made us whiter than snow, and we know that no matter what our physical state is, rich or poor, in good health or in sickness, in or out of relationships, financial success or setback, it has no bearing on our eternal inheritance that no one and nothing can take away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;buried-and-raised-with-christ&quot;&gt;Buried and raised with Christ&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is useless; you are still in your sins. (1 Corinthians 15:17)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him.  We know that since Christ has been raised from the dead, he is never going to die again; death no longer has mastery over him.. (Romans 6:8-9)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Therefore we have been buried with him through baptism into death, in order that just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we too may live a new life. (Romans 6:4)​&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Christ was raised from the dead, and so were you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;god-in-us&quot;&gt;God in us&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And when you heard the word of truth (the gospel of your salvation)–when you believed in Christ–you were marked with the seal of the promised Holy Spirit, (Ephesians 1:13)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;He redeemed us in order that the blessing promised to Abraham would come to the Gentiles in Christ Jesus, so that &lt;u&gt;by faith&lt;/u&gt; we might receive the promise of the Spirit. (Galatians 3:14)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can one who is indwelled with the Holy Spirit still be dead and need to be awakened? He’s alive more than Adam before the Fall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;presented-to-god-as-without-blemish&quot;&gt;Presented to God as without blemish&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But now he has reconciled you by his physical body through death to present you holy, without blemish, and blameless before him. (Colossians 1:22)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that our being holy and without blemish does not mean that we possess these qualities in and of ourselves, but it is an imparted perfection bestowed upon us from Christ. How can you be more alive than this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;drowsiness-as-part-of-life&quot;&gt;Drowsiness as part of life&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember the &lt;a href=&quot;https://vacsf.org/articles/Parable-Ten-Virgins/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;parable of the ten virgins&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; when all of them, both the wise and the foolish, fell asleep while waiting for the bridegroom to arrive? The parable pointed out that the problem with the foolish virgins were not because of their falling asleep, as the wise ones, too, did fall asleep, but because they embarked on the journey without the essential and absolutely required ingredient: oil for their lamps. The drowsiness experienced by the virgins may take many forms in the human experience, as a matter of fact, it is through the setbacks in life which there are many that the Lord prepares us for eternity. Some may advise you to stay awake and be always watchful, I’ll say you need to enter God’s rest as often as you can (Hebrews 4:11).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;youre-alive-forevermore&quot;&gt;You’re alive forevermore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The call for dead souls to awake from their slumber of death no longer applies to those who have transitioned from death to life as they placed their trust in Christ. But many believers do not know that. They would hear the call and accept it as normal, that they should wake up to something better than where they currently are, in a manner and belief not any different than adherents of religions that believe in some form of reincarnations through which they may advance to a better state of existence. In using a shifting standard to evaluate their standing before God and their relationship with him, their cannot have peace, and therefore they will always worry about what the Lord thinks about them. This is not the way to live a Christian life, they should instead heed the call of the Hebrews writer’s admonition to fix their eyes on Jesus (Hebrews 12:2; John 3:14). Though they may lead lives of goodness and virtues, they no longer count on them toward their standing before God, but instead they rely only on Christ’s own righteousness for their qualification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-the-big-deal&quot;&gt;What’s the big deal?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a big deal because if the critical matter of assurance of salvation cannot be settled, the believers will spend the rest of their lives trying to achieve what Christ already accomplished for them. They will be like a dog chasing its own tail, toiling in the circle of frustration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though the believers may at times grow weary, or become drowsy and fall asleep as the time of Christ’s second coming may not happen in their lifetime, they don’t need to be awakened as if they might be in a sleep of death. No matter what state they might be in, their place in the heart of God is secure as it is signed and sealed by the blood of the Lamb of God and the very breath of Life of the Holy Spirit just as it was when he breathed into the nostril of Adam and he became a living being. No matter what their temporal state might be, living in peace and tranquility with good health, or attacked from all sides by circumstances beyond their feeble attempt to control, there is a certainty in their hearts of their perfect standing before the Most High God as they’re fully clothed in the righteousness of Christ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A misapplication of Isaiah 51:17 may be consequential in that the central focus of the verse is shifted from what God will do to what man will try to achieve, from God’s immovable plan of salvation to man’s futile attempt to achieve what only Christ can. One brings hope, the other brings hopelessness. How this little verse is interpreted can tell you a lot about the ministry that uses it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grace and peace be with you.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;You must have heard people refer to themselves as born-again Christians, but what does it really mean to be born again?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;nicodemus&quot;&gt;Nicodemus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://vacsf.org/assets/images/born-again-teaser.jpg&quot; style=&quot;border: 1px solid #cccccc; margin: 7px 15px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 148px; padding: 0px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;
In the gospel of John, chapter 3, it is recorded of a man named Nicodemus, who was a rabbi of rabbi who taught the law of God to all of Israel. He had always been highly regarded in Isarael all his life, yet something began to gnaw at him since the time he resolved in his heart that he would learn God’s law and keep them the best he could. His photographic memory allowed him to learn and remember things he read, and he kept growing larger in the mind of his contemporary, until one day he became the greatest of them all. But somehow he felt all his effort to reach perfection was not enough, his credentials could fool all his peers but not his own heart that all the accomplishments, though as impressive as they were, would not be enough for him to enter the kingdom of God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Now a certain man, a Pharisee named Nicodemus, who was a member of the Jewish ruling council,  &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; came to Jesus at night and said to him, “Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher who has come from God. For no one could perform the miraculous signs that you do unless God is with him.” (John 3:1-2)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having seen Jesus perform miracles that had never been done before, and having heard him debate the teachers of the law as well as teach the common folks with such authority, he felt a strange but wonderful sense of hope rising up in his heart. He pondered if this man might be the Messiah that our people have been waiting for?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;born-by-flesh&quot;&gt;Born by flesh&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; Jesus replied, “I tell you the solemn truth, unless a person is born from above, he cannot see the kingdom of God.”  &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; Nicodemus said to him, “How can a man be born when he is old? He cannot enter his mother’s womb and be born a second time, can he?” (John 3:3-4)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this man Jesus said something that puzzled him to no end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his Jewish tradition, Nicodemus had experienced being born again several times in his life, once when he transitioned to adulthood and celebrated it with a Bar Mitzvah, once when he got married, once when he graduated from rabbinical school, and lastly once when he became a teacher of rabbis. There can be no more being born again for Nicodemus as there is no transitioning to a higher position in life for him. Yet, Jesus told him if he was to see the kingdom of God, he must be born again. So it must have been a rhetorical question when he asked Jesus whether he should go back to his mother’s womb and start all over again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that in the mindset of a Jew, a rebirth has to do with a transition from one position in life to another as in Nicodemus’ experience. This is not much different from the way many Christians think of a rebirth: you used to do something, now you do something else. You used to spend the weekends in worldly pursuits, now you spend time in the Word, in fellowship with other believers and worshipping God. And many other positive changes that must occur as a proof of one’s rebirth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Jesus, this is not a prescription to either Jews or Gentiles for an admission to the kingdom of God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;born-from-above&quot;&gt;Born from above&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;Jesus answered, “I tell you the solemn truth, unless a person is born of water and spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God.  …  &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; Do not be amazed that I said to you, ‘You must all be born from above.’ (John 4:5,7)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer is NO. This rebirth is from above, by the spirit of God. Even the person who experiences this rebirth does not know how it comes about. This is how it is different from the experiences of either the Israelites or in the common perception of most Christians. This must be the reason why when asked in our Sunday School class for a definition of the meaning of the term “born again,” the answer of most never failed to point to an expectation of some positive changes in something they do or in their lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least in Nicodemus’ experience, his rebirths were more well defined and agreed upon by most if not all Israelites. The Christians on the contrary cannot point their finger at something that can define their rebirth, so they keep chasing it until they become resigned to the possibility that it’s just a nice theological term to be preached on ad nauseam without producing any lasting effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;flesh-vs-spirit&quot;&gt;Flesh vs. spirit&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; What is born of the flesh is flesh, and what is born of the Spirit is spirit. …  &lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; The wind blows wherever it will, and you hear the sound it makes, but do not know where it comes from and where it is going. So it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit.” (John 4:6,8)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is born of the flesh? Everything that comes from a man, no matter how noble or seemingly spiritual, is from his flesh. But spiritual pride is as alluring as the forbidden fruit, and man will find ways to put on a robe of self righteousness like Adam and Eve when they put on the ancient fig leaves. They always will try to elevate themselves with spiritual sounding words, with pious platitude that even Jesus had never attempted though he’s God and he has every right and ability to do so without fear of hypocrisy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A mighty work may be considered noble in the eyes of peers, but born of the flesh nonetheless. And if it’s of the flesh, it’s not from above, therefore it is useless in carrying its performer into God’s presence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the work of God that born a man again from above is mysterious even to the one who is subjected to it, much like leaves that are blown by the wind, they perform no work except to receive the effect of the force that is external to them. And therefore &lt;em&gt;“So it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;living-by-faith&quot;&gt;Living by faith&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it is true that God may have prepared from everlasting the works of his kingdom for those who have been called by him (Ephesians 2:10), he only does so for those who have been born from above, as no works will ever be the cause, or the requirements, of such spiritual rebirth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet there is one work, the only one by the Son of God, that is powerful enough and acceptable to God to bridge heaven and earth, to reconcile sinful man and the holy God, to bring the prodigal son back to the father, to grant us the rebirth that is absolutely required to usher us into God’s presence. Any work proposed by anyone or any other system of faith is in direct competition to what Christ had accomplished on the cross.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, the only means through which one inherits a spiritual rebirth is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The work of God is this: to believe in the one he has sent. (John 6:29)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;And in Him, having heard and believed the word of truth—the gospel of your salvation—you were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit, &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;who is the pledge of our inheritance until the redemption of those who are God’s possession, to the praise of His glory. (Ephesians 1:13-14)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as at our birth at the beginning of creation, the Holy Spirit breathed man into life, but that life was lost to Adam, now he’s breathing it again to those who are restored to him through God’s Son. The rebirth was once and always will be the work of the Almighty, and it can only be received as a free gift.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A well known Bible expositor wrote a book, whose title is borrowed for this article, to help believers prepare themselves against the day of Christ’s return. This article proposes a more certain, and Scripture-based, way to be ready for that day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-action-guide&quot;&gt;The action guide&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://vacsf.org/assets/images/7-days-teaser.jpg&quot; style=&quot;border: 1px solid #cccccc; margin: 7px 15px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 148px; padding: 0px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;
The author appeals to Jesus’ command to believers to be servants of others, and to the gifts God gives to each believer according to the parable of the talents, and other positive things they should do in preparing themselves for the day Christ comes again. This article will examine and rebut several faulty assumptions delivered in the sermon that was used as the basis for the action guide. The article is not written as an attack of the expositor or his ministries, but it sees the topic as emblematic of the common teachings that stunt believer’s growth, putting doubts in their relationship with God, and instead proposes a more Scriptural approach to achieve the readiness with certainty. Here’s the introduction to the “7 Days Until Christ Returns - An Action Guide.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What would you do if you knew Jesus would return in seven days? Though the Bible clearly tells us that no man knows the date when Christ will return, it is an interesting and profound exercise to look at how our lives might change if we had the knowledge that Christ would return seven days from now. What would you do? Would your daily routine change? What is standing between you and the Lord that you would want to make right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-dilemma&quot;&gt;The dilemma&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the expositor, though believers are doctrinally saved as they placed their trust in Christ, they must still face his judgement seat to give an answer to how they live while still in the flesh. Another well known expositor also gives this description of the judgement seat of Christ: &lt;em&gt;“Thus, the purpose of the judgment seat of Christ is to examine a Christian’s total life. We will be recompensed for the deeds we have done, whether good or bad (2 Cor. 5:10). The term used there refers to a summing up and estimation of the total pattern of a believer’s life. “&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question that must be asked is: can the totality of a Christian’s relationship with God be compartmentalized into the parts before and after they’re saved, or specifically the unconditional forgiveness of their sins and the conditional rewards, or the lack thereof, that follow? Is there truth in the assertion that the completely grace-based gift of eternal life and the work-based recompense of the deeds while still in the flesh are all summed up to make up the total worth of a believer’s life?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Christian journey through life usually follows a pattern where the grace-based gift of forgiveness of sins and eternal life recedes back to the brief moment in time when the believer expressed his trust in Christ, then yielded to the long stretch of the years ahead filled with question of one’s worth before the Lord: am I good enough for the Christ who is coming back? The assurance of salvation gradually fades away to the point the believer questions whether if it was even real, then subsequently he’s resigned to the possibility that he might not be saved after all. The question whether he’s done enough as he examines his deeds looms large in his mind, and perhaps like most believers he would instinctively pushes it to the back of his mind. The believer might return from the sermon full of zeal and a sense of purpose, maybe for the full 7 days, but those days will soon pass, and if he’s to continue the pattern of zeal any further he will most likely find himself worn out from the superhuman effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now back to the topic from which this article was prompted to be written. The author of &lt;em&gt;“7 Days Until Christ Returns”&lt;/em&gt; proposes two reasons why believers should do their utmost to prepare themselves to meet their Lord: 1) Christ’s call to servanthood, and 2) the talents he’s given to each and everyone. Let’s examine each one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;servanthood&quot;&gt;Servanthood&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The author expounds on the servanthood attitude of believers, which is without doubt a virtue fitting for anyone who calls on the name of Christ. However, let us recall the context of this writing. The author puts us in the hypothetical 7 days before Christ returns which puts us in a more urgent state than normal. With only 7 days left, is servanthood likely among the most urgent thing to take care of? I’d venture not. Servanthood is more like a lifestyle, a pattern of living that characterizes a Christian’s life journey whether he has seven days left or not. It’s a fruit of a life born of the Spirit of God. But why stop at servanthood? There is forgiveness, compassion, humility, a giving heart, making amends, bible study, visiting the sick, and myriad other things high on the list of virtues Christians aspire to develop especially during these short 7 days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can a Christian realistically choose one most important thing he can do during the seven short days to make him more ready to meet his Lord? For the sake of argument, let’s just say we go easy and allow the Christian to pick only one most important thing on his list to accomplish on these seven days, and let’s say it’s servanthood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the possibility that this Christian finds exactly a perfect opportunity to serve someone during this time? What is the likelyhood he will find something that has eluded him all the years before this hypothetical seven days? And lastly, will it make him more ready than he’d ever been? The answer to all these questions is a resounding NO. Christians have been doing this since the time of the book of Acts. They keep looking for something that makes them more on fire for God, something that magically transform their spiritual life. But there is no such thing, as everything ever proposed by someone has been proposed by someone else before, and nothing ever brought them closer to their goal. Servanthood, a nice idea, but as vague and as unmeasurable as any other lofty ideals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-talents&quot;&gt;The talents&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a major problem with using the parable of the talents to prepare Christians to meet God because it is not about &lt;em&gt;“recompense for the deeds done while in the flesh,”&lt;/em&gt; or about rewards or the lack thereof. It’s about salvation, who will be saved and who will not be. The evidence for this is in the last verse of this parable: &lt;em&gt;“As for this worthless slave, throw him into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth (Matthew 25:30).”&lt;/em&gt; God does not call his sanctified saint &lt;em&gt;“worthless slave”&lt;/em&gt; and he will not cast them into outer darkness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, our Lord God is nothing like the slave owner in this parable. He never reaps where he does not sow. And not only does he sow, he sows the amazing seed of the gospel: his only begotten Son.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, when this parable is applied indiscrimately to Christians, it cannot help but put them in the mindset of unsaved people, instead of allowing them to work out their salvation as children of God, it brings them back to the place where they’re still alienated from God and had to work to earn their salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;faulty-application&quot;&gt;Faulty application&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far we’ve seen that the two basic premises of 7-Days put the believers in a wrong place in their attempt to prepare them for the day of Christ’s return. Though the expositor assures listeners that they’re already saved, in his encouraging them to better prepare themselves, he puts doubt in their minds that they may not be saved after all. The parable of the talents, in its being misapplied, is the principle offender.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the doctrinally erroneous applications of the servanthood exhortation and the parable of the talents, the practical implication is also great. How much is enough of my servitude, and to whom? How many talents have I been blessed with and how have I performed? No one knows with any certainty whether his achievements will be accepted by Christ upon his return. It’s all guesswork, and arbitrary. This is no way for the bridesmaids to wait for the arrival of their bridegroom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our faith in God, our hope of salvation, must be infinitely more certain than what is put forth in the &lt;em&gt;“7 Days Until Christ Returns.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. (Hebrews 11:1)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;false-premise&quot;&gt;False premise&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can a Christian live the rest of his life as if each day is one of the last seven days before Christ returns?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sermon, or the book, might be able to spur the believers to actions for maybe all the seven days, but the self imposed sense of urgency cannot realistically last for any long stretch of time or burnout will set in, and the brief experiment will prove itself to be another failed attempt in moving one on a higher spiritual plane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-once-for-all-perfection&quot;&gt;The once for all perfection&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For by a single offering he has &lt;strong&gt;perfected for all time&lt;/strong&gt; those who are sanctified (Hebrews 10:14).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is how we should prepare ourselves for the day of Christ’s return: to put our hope on what Christ had achieved for us instead of what we can produce with our flesh. If God has made us perfect in Christ, what is it that we’re lacking that causes him to withhold rewards from us? Are you relying on your own sacrifices and offerings or on the &lt;em&gt;“single offering”&lt;/em&gt; prepared by God himself which alone can make you &lt;em&gt;“perfect for all time?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fix your eyes upon Jesus (Hebrews 12:2), my friends. That’s how you prepare for 1 Day, for 7 Days, or even for the rest of your life as you await Christ’ return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;He who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all–how will he not also, along with him, graciously give us all things?  (Romans 8:32)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if God graciously gives you all things along with his Son, will he be stingy about little things that you flesh can produce? Actually you should be glad that he’s not giving you rewards for what that comes from your flesh, because if he does, you may not like it. The rewards are actually threats that if you walk according to the letter of the law, its fruit will you reap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You who are trying to be justified by the law have been alienated from Christ; you have fallen away from grace (Galatians_5:4)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;recompense&quot;&gt;Recompense&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before reaching the conclusion of this article, let us recall the quote of the well known author who refered to 2 Corinthians 5:10 to use in the same vein of thought as the author who erroneously quotes the parable of the talent to keep Christians on their toes as they wait for their Lord’s return. In the same manner as the misapplication of the parable of the talent, the Corinthians verse was also grossly misapplied to the detriment of anyone who subscribes to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the context of 2 Corinthians 5:10 is used, we’d find that the recompense is not meant for Christians as rewards and punishments for actions they perform while in the flesh, but only as the outcome of one of the two choices one makes concerning Christ. The verse that follows helps explain why this is the case:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Therefore, because we know the fear of the Lord, we try to persuade people (2 Corinthians 5:11)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul was talking about a recompense before the judgement seat of Christ where the choice to believe in him leads to life while the choice of not believing leads to death. Therefore, in verse 11, Paul was conveying a message of reconciliation to his audience. He was not at all talking about rewards or the lack there of. The author of 7 Days, though tried to assure his audience that their salvation is secure, by presenting the parable of the talents or 2 Corinthians 5:10 in this manner, puts them in the same footing with unbelievers where the deprivation of reward is equally alarming as the danger of being alienated from God. This explains why those who subscribe to this belief system do not have any assurance of their salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;in-conclusion&quot;&gt;In conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Christians do not live a life of working toward rewards, but of waiting for the day they receive their &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;inheritance&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Rewards are unknown until they are given to their recipients, but an inheritance is known, though sealed as a promise, or a guarantee, and to be received in full just as we read in Romans 8:32.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What rewards can match the wonderful parts of our inheritance in Christ? Consider these: the indwelling Holy Spirit as a deposit guaranteeing our inheritance (Ephesians 1:11-14), the forgiveness of sins (Colossians 1:14), our sanctification and justification (1 Corinthians 6:11), Christ as our advocate (1 John 2:1), and every wonderful things included in Christ (Romans 8:32).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, exhortations such as 7-Days makes a normal Christian life abnormal, it replaces contentment with dissatisfaction, it takes away thanksgiving for what God has given and replace it with yearning for what seems to be greater blessings enjoyed by others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the parable of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://vacsf.org/articles/Parable-Ten-Virgins/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ten Virgins&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, all ten virgins, both the wise and the foolish, fell asleep while waiting for the bridegroom who was a long time in coming. There was no indication of any difference in lifestyle, activities, or performance, between the wise and the foolish virgins, except one thing: the oil the virgins should take with them before they embark on their journey. That was the only thing that counts. That was how they should prepare to meet their Lord, for neither servanthood nor talents would get them the oil they needed.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Few Christians know that there is an old covenant and there is a new one, but even fewer really know why there are two, and know enough of their differences to experience a transformation by the renewing of their mind, a paradigm shift in how they relate to their God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;stuck-in-the-old-way&quot;&gt;Stuck in the old way&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://vacsf.org/assets/images/old-vs-new.jpg&quot; style=&quot;border: 1px solid #cccccc; margin: 7px 15px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 148px; padding: 0px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;
Most Christians relate to God in the same way the people of Israel did under the Old Covenant. While the Israelites offered bulls and goats or other sacrifices for their sins, the Christians offer apologies, acts of penance, myriad forms of pious deeds, in their place. Little did they know, or rather if they read the Bible and understand it they should already know, that these acts are completely worthless toward their attempt to draw near to God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href=&quot;http://vacsf.org/parable/The-Net&quot;&gt;Parable of the Net&lt;/a&gt;, Jesus spoke of the a house owner who brought out new and old things from his treasure. Though Jesus did not elaborate on what the owner was going to do with them, we can safely deduce from the first two examples in this parable in which bad fish were discarded and wicked people were thrown into the fiery furnace, that the house owner would discard the old and keep the new. The theme of the abolishing of the old while ushering in the new is continued in force in the Hebrews passage we’re studying here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;hebrews-101-20&quot;&gt;Hebrews 10:1-20&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For the law possesses a shadow of the good things to come but not the reality itself, and is therefore &lt;u&gt;completely unable&lt;/u&gt;, by the same sacrifices offered continually, year after year, &lt;u&gt;to perfect&lt;/u&gt; those who come to worship. (Hebrews 10:1)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sacrifices, the apologies, the acknowledgement of guilt, the self denial, the harsh treatment of self (Colossians 2:23), cannot make them more acceptable to God. Yet God does require perfection of those who want to bathe themselves in his glory (Matthew 5:48).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let read on to the Hebrews verse that follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For otherwise would they not have &lt;u&gt;ceased to be offered&lt;/u&gt;, since the worshipers would have been purified once for all and so have &lt;u&gt;no further consciousness of sin?&lt;/u&gt; (Hebrews 10:2)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the Hebrews verse above, were the pious things you do to get right with God effective at all, they should have &lt;em&gt;“ceased to be offered.”&lt;/em&gt; No more sacrifices, no more acts of penance, no more sin confessions, for if you have been &lt;em&gt;“purified once for all”&lt;/em&gt; and have &lt;em&gt;“no further consciousness of sin,”&lt;/em&gt; why should there till be any need for those acts? But for some inexplicable reason, the Christians still perform these acts in various forms. It must be because they don’t feel they’re good enough for God. There are more sins to be forgiven, more sanctification to strive for, more of something they have a vague inkling of in their mind that they need to arrive at before they can be fully acceptable to God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Hebrews writer goes on to show why the Christians are stuck in this vicious cycle of sinning and confession, of transgressions and repentance or making amends. The following verse shows us why:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But in those sacrifices there is a reminder of sins year after year.  For the blood of bulls and goats cannot take away sins. (Hebrews 10:3-4)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The blood of bulls and goats, the acts of contrition, the making of amends, not only cannot take away sins, they remind the worshippers of what that stand between them and God: their sins. That’s the reason why so many Christians live in a state of perpetual guilt and a sense of inadequacy toward God, because as long as they still have &lt;em&gt;“consciousness of sin,”&lt;/em&gt; they cannot draw near to God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope by now the reader is resolved in his mind that many things commonly practiced and adhered to by most Christians and taught by virtually all preachers for thousands of years have been leading them in a vicious cycle, much like the journey of the Israelites in the desert. The Ten Commandments given them from mount Sinai did exactly that: they remind them of their sins instead of removing them. They didn’t realize that the commandments are not their path to redemption, but formidable barriers that no sinner can cross.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Hebrews passage that follows is nothing short of revolutionary, it demolishes all popular ideas of worship and devotion, and it was foreshadowed in the Old Testament (Psalms 40:6-8):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;So when he came into the world, he said,&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“Sacrifice and offering you did not desire, but a body you prepared for me.  “Whole burnt offerings and sin-offerings you took no delight in. “Then I said, ‘Here I am: I have come - it is written of me in the scroll of the book - to do your will, O God.’”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;When he says above, “Sacrifices and offerings and whole burnt offerings and sin-offerings you did not desire nor did you take delight in them” (which are offered according to the law), then he says, “Here I am: I have come to do your will.” He does away with the first to establish the second.  By his will we have been made holy through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all. (Hebrews 10:5-10)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The very things people think will pave their way to God’s throne, such as their sacrifices and acts of worship and devotion, are neither desired nor taken delight by God. Yet the world is saturated with messages and how-to’s of countless ways to access God’s throne.  But as stated earlier in prior Hebrews’ verses, these things actually led people in circles of frustration, trapping them in the desert of false humility and spirituality. They serve as &lt;em&gt;“a reminder of sins”&lt;/em&gt; (Hebrews 10:3-4) instead of blotting them out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Jesus came to give people a new way to relate to Him, a way that can truly make them holy once for all. And when he establishes this new way for people to relate to him, he abolishes the old way, the way of sacrifices and offerings, be they sacrifice of praise modeled after the sentiment of King David. What is included in this new way, the only and exclusive way that is according to the will of God: the offering of the body of Jesus Christ. This new and living way supersedes all the ways people have used in ages past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Therefore, brothers and sisters, since we have confidence to enter the sanctuary by the blood of Jesus,  by the fresh and living way that he inaugurated for us through the curtain, that is, through his flesh (Hebrews 10:19-20)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has been an exposition on Hebrews 10:1-20, which was inspired by the following quote of Augustin. The reader would do well to understand the contrast between the new and the old covenants referenced in this quote:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;augustine-on-old-vs-new&quot;&gt;Augustine on Old vs New&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;‘I beg of you, however, carefully to observe, as far as you can, what I am endeavouring to prove with so much effort.  When the prophet promised a new covenant, &lt;strong&gt;not according to the covenant which had been formerly made with the people of Israel&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;when liberated from Egypt&lt;/strong&gt;, he said nothing about a change in the sacrifices or any sacred ordinances, although such change, too, was without doubt to follow, as we see in fact that it did follow, even as the same prophetic scripture testifies in many other passages; &lt;strong&gt;but he simply called attention to THIS difference, NAMELY, that God would impress His laws on the MIND of those who belonged to this (New) covenant, and would write them in their HEARTS&lt;/strong&gt;, (Jer 31:32-33) whence the apostle drew his conclusion&lt;strong&gt;,—“not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart;”&lt;/strong&gt; (2 Cor 3:3).  &lt;strong&gt;It is therefore apparent what difference there is between the old covenant and the new&lt;/strong&gt;,—that in the former the law is written on tables, while in the latter on hearts; &lt;strong&gt;so that what in the one alarms from without, in the other delights from within;&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;in the former, man becomes a transgressor through the letter that kills, in the other, a lover through the life-giving spirit.’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The title of a popular Christian song that expresses the desire for change in a believer’s heart. This crying out from deep within of large majority of believers is emblematic of their understanding of the gospel. How do they expect their hearts to be changed? This article will show where the real issues are and a real and realizable answer to a yearning, a thirst that should have been quenched by the water of l.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-initial-joy-of-salvation&quot;&gt;The initial joy of salvation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://vacsf.org/assets/images/Change-my-heart-oh-God-teaser.jpg&quot; style=&quot;border: 1px solid #cccccc; margin: 7px 15px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 148px; padding: 0px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;
Though I didn’t walk down the aisle to answer the call to place my trust in Christ in the manner commonly observed at evangelistic events, there were tears streaming down my face, there was a lightness of being as I felt my soul being cleansed from the burden of sin, there was a profound sense of being loved by a power external to my heart that caused me to tremble in a strange but wonderful gladness, and a waterfall of joy that flooded my being. But this is by no means more special or valid than the experiences of others that may be more subtle, and perhaps more from the mind than the heart.  I believe God gives each person an entrance into his kingdom in as unique a way as the individuality that he skillfully crafted into them. Yet for those whose conversion to Christianity is less than spectacular, they yearn for the glorious experiences that they heard from other’s t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But no matter how glorious the initial joy of salvation might have been, it’s not meant to last forever. Most testimonies only record the mountain top moments, and though they’re far and few in between what commonly experienced by the large majority of Christians, they’re often cited as the standard against which we must measure our faith. Shortly after the glorious moment of conversion, the Christian begins to wonder if their heart might have grown cold, if they might have failed God, that there might be something more that they missed, and there’s more to be done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-heart-is-not-right&quot;&gt;My heart is not right&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So they cry out: &lt;em&gt;“Change my heart oh God.”&lt;/em&gt; The lyric and the melody of the song soothes the soul of the worshipers. It quenches their thirst for the living water they once tasted when they came to their Savior on bended knees and with teary eyes. It provides a moment of tranquility, of respite from the burdens that life brings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But these wonderful benefits vanish as soon as the last musical note ended. The state of the heart remains the same. Unchanged. At least by the believer’s own estimation. There would still be the same craving for something more, the same feeling that there is something incomplete. This sense of incompleteness may result in the inkling that their heart  is not right with God, that they’re not fully accepted by Him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The believer is not quite sure what is missing. Should he spend more time on his knees praying? More Bible study? More church related activities? But he’s done all that already. He’s faithfully attending church, revival camps, he teaches Sunday School, visit the sick. He’s always available when the body of Christ needs him, for church renovation, for whatever his multitude of talents is needed to minister to others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Occasional visits from missionaries or some sort of God workers stirred in his heart a longing to do something more; perhaps he could join them in their next endeavor, or at least he could participate in setting aside a part of his day to pray toward it. Maybe he can assist them financially.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So he keeps singing Change My Heart Oh God as it perfectly expresses how he feels about his relationship with God. But does this believer know how his heart should be changed? All he knows is he still feels a vacuum in his heart but has no idea how it can be filled. No matter how busy he keeps himself doing the Lord’s work, the emptiness seems only to grow larger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;is-my-heart-meant-to-be-right-with-god&quot;&gt;Is my heart meant to be right with God?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems the believer is falling right back into work-based religion. When he first came to God, he came with empty hands, yet he felt an unspeakable joy. God’s grace was a concept he could grasp as he knew without any doubt the sonship of God he had was truly an undeserved favor, now he’s trying so hard to prove that he’s worthy of the sacrifice of the Son of  God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, this believer got it all wrong. He, or his heart, has never been, and will never be right with God, for to be right with Him he must be perfect, sinless, as pure as Adam and Eve before the Fall. When he knelt before the cross the first time, he acknowledged he could not meet God’s righteous requirement, he relinquished his judgement of right and wrong which Adam and Eve acquired for him as they ate of the forbidden fruit. He was resigned to the fact that the only One who could please God was Christ, and he gladly accepted what Christ did on the cross was a gift that he could freely receive. Why is it that now he feels it isn’t enough? What else must he do to make up for what Christ missed, if indeed the Lord missed something in his work of reconciling him to the Father?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This writing will not show you how to get right with God, it will not show you how to change your heart, or have a changed heart, but it will show you how to love the man, or the woman, that God has already loved and accepted so completely through His Son.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;everything-you-need&quot;&gt;Everything you need&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;He who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all, how will he not also, along with him, graciously give us all things? (Romans 8:32)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All things means exactly that: ALL things. All things you need for godliness and contentment. All things you need to be more than conquerors in Christ Jesus (Romans 8:37). All things you need to boldly enter God’s throne of grace (Hebrews 10:20). All things to make you fully acceptable to God. Not at some point in the future, not something you get incrementally, but right now, and fully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There is NOW no longer any condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus (Romans 8:1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So are you in Christ? If you are, your soul can rest, your work is done, the work of believing in the One God has sent (John 6:29).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If God has fully accepted you, he must have also fully accepted your heart. Then why week in, week out, your heart still cries out to God to be changed? How can it be that a child of God who is so loved and accepted by God still find it difficult to love and accept himself? Were it the Lord’s will to change the believer’s heart, wouldn’t he be the best one to know when and how to get it done? The Lord is the molder and his subject is but clay in his hand. If he’s pleased of the state of his creation, who are we to question his work, or to hurry his hand?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;… Now he has reconciled you by his physical body through death to present you holy, without blemish, and blameless before him -  if indeed you remain in the faith, established and firm, without shifting from the hope of the gospel that you heard (Colossians 1:22-23).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you want any more than what God has stated that it’s finished? As a matter of fact this was what Jesus uttered on the cross before he took his last breath. He declared that the work to present you as &lt;em&gt;“holy, without blemish, and blameless before God”&lt;/em&gt; was done. Therefore Jesus is now resting at the right hand of the Father as a testament to the re-creation he has done in the lives of those who put their trust in him. He resurrected fallen Man and he declared that it was good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;just-as-i-am&quot;&gt;Just as I am&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Just as I am, thou wilt receive,
wilt welcome, pardon, cleanse, relieve;
because thy promise I believe,
O Lamb of God, I come, I come (Hymn Just as I Am, Without One Plea)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as you were when you first knelt before your Redeemer, so are you now as you walk with Him the rest of your days. Your heart, whatever the state that it may be in, might it be filled with the joy of salvation, or weary and falling into a state of drowsiness like the virgins in Jesus’ parable, might it be calm as it perceives that everything makes sense, or in great anxiety as everything seems to be going wrong, God’s love for that heart will never change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To you who sings Change My Heart Oh God without seeing its incompatibility with your new identity in Christ, perhaps you’re basing the assurance of your salvation upon a shaky foundation. You’re basing it upon yourself, your state of mind, or heart, your ability, or whatever else that comes from your very self. No, you should not do that, but instead you should base it on Christ and what he accomplished on the cross.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The song reflects a believer who is obsessed with himself, one who engages in morbid introspection. But we are admonished by not just the Hebrews writer (Hebrews 12:2), but by Jesus himself that we should fix our eyes on him, as he says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the wilderness, so the Son of Man must be lifted up, that everyone who believes in Him may have eternal life (John 3:14-15).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you keep trying to change your heart, or asking God to change it for that matter, chances are good that you won’t experience any changes at all, but if you fix your eyes on Jesus, you might find that even you can accept your own heart, as God has accepted it so, and changes might come swiftly when you least expect it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, your heart has already been changed though you may not feel it, and others may not see it, but its right standing before God has been signed and sealed by the very promise of God long ago:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come: The old has gone, the new is here! (2 Corinthians 5:17—NIV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Live by faith, o God’s righteous ones, for the just shall live by faith (Romans 1:17, Galatians 3:11, Hebrews 10:38). Trust in God that he has already given you a new heart. Don’t ask God to change your heart any more, but instead live as if you already possess a new heart.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Most people ponder the question “What must I do to inherit the kingdom of God?” Case in point is it is the same question the rich young ruler asked Jesus in Matthew 19:16. It’s a good question, but the answer is not what most folks are looking for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-assumption&quot;&gt;The assumption&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://vacsf.org/assets/images/what-is-good-teaser.jpg&quot; style=&quot;border: 1px solid #cccccc; margin: 7px 15px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 148px; padding: 0px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;
Faithful adherents of practically all religions of the world try to solve the problem of what good deeds they must do to get to the place promised in their systems of beliefs. Resisting sins is part of the solution, part of the “good deeds” they must do, but it is still a much narrower aspect of the whole range of good deeds that they must navigate. Thus in asking such question, they’re possessed by a fallacy that they can indeed do all the good deeds required to enter God’s kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us consider the main Scripture passage of this article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;matthew-1916-22&quot;&gt;Matthew 19:16-22&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; Now someone came up to him and said, Teacher, what good thing must I do to gain eternal life? &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt; He said to him, &lt;strong&gt;Why do you ask me about what is good? There is only one who is good&lt;/strong&gt;. But if you want to enter into life, keep the commandments. &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; Which ones? he asked. Jesus replied, Do not murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not give false testimony, &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt; honor your father and mother, and love your neighbor as yourself. &lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; The young man said to him, I have wholeheartedly obeyed all these laws. What do I still lack? &lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt; Jesus said to him, &lt;strong&gt;If you wish to be perfect&lt;/strong&gt;, go sell your possessions and give the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me. &lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt; But when the young man heard this he went away sorrowful, for he was very rich.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-must-i-do&quot;&gt;What must I do?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question, posed to Jesus by the rich young ruler in the passage, is representative of the thinking of virtually everyone when it comes to the matter of salvation, or eternal life. It’s an inescapable fact. There are things to be done. There are rituals, practices, and countless methods people conjure up to perhaps satisfy some arbitrary requirements of whichever deities they worship. In my own cultural experience, though people may not possess any notion of eternal life, or any deity, they expect rewards and blessings for good deeds they’ve done in this life, and perhaps in the life beyond. All they need to do is to cross their fingers and do the right thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The young ruler’s question to Jesus is no exception, and likewise has two fundamental problems: 1) the assumption that works, some things they do, can get them into God’s kingdom, and 2) the very reference to &lt;strong&gt;good work&lt;/strong&gt; in the question. The apostle Paul addresses the first problem in most of his letters—salvation is by grace, not works—, while the error in the second problem is indirectly answered by Jesus and further confirmed throughout Scriptures, especially in Paul’s letters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;works-and-eternal-life&quot;&gt;Works and eternal life&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Works are good things all Christians should do. They give them a chance to work out their faith through gifts endowed from above, to feel a sense of personal significance as they participate in God’s works toward His kingdom, plus many other benefits. But works contribute nothing toward our entering into the kingdom of God, and His righteousness. It’s when these works are elevated as if they can make or break our relationship with God, they steal the glory of God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ephesians 2:8-9 says we’re saved by faith and not by works. Additionally, the works that we do are not something we come up with on our own, but are those that God had prepared for each and every one of His children according to His infinite wisdom: &lt;em&gt;“For we are his workmanship, having been created in Christ Jesus for good works that &lt;strong&gt;God prepared beforehand&lt;/strong&gt; so we may do them (Ephesians 2:10).”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hebrews 10:10 puts this in a different way:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;By his will we have been made holy through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all (Hebrews 10:10).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be made holy is to be set apart for God’s kingdom, the very thing sought after by the rich young ruler in Matthew 19:16. It’s not any works, even the best of good works, but the offering of the body of Christ that makes the young man holy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God clearly insists in Romans 11:6 that salvation can never be based on any works of man but by God, and He gives it freely to those who believe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And if [&lt;em&gt;salvation is&lt;/em&gt;] by grace, then it cannot be based on works; if it were, grace would no longer be grace (Romans 11:6).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can cite many more verses that will completely demolish any idea that people may enter God’s kingdom through some works of their own, but these should suffice. However the problem with most Christians is not that they don’t believe they’re saved by grace, it’s their utter dependence on works to maintain their relationship with God. They believe that the works that they do after they’re saved will make them more holy, more perfect, until the day they meet God. They call it the sanctification process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this is not what the Bible says. It says we’re both saved and then live by faith alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For by grace you are saved through faith, and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God; it is not from works, so that no one can boast (Ephesians 2:8-9).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;For the righteousness of God is revealed in the gospel &lt;strong&gt;from faith to faith&lt;/strong&gt;, just as it is written, “The righteous shall &lt;strong&gt;live by faith&lt;/strong&gt;.” (Romans 1:17; Galatians 3:11; Hebrews 10:38)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Works, those initiated and powered by the flesh, cannot get us in God’s kingdom because they neither please God nor satisfy His righteous requirements. Therefore it stands to reason that neither will these works please God in the part of life post salvation. This truth is confirmed in Romans 1:17 quoted above: &lt;em&gt;“For the righteousness of God is revealed in the gospel &lt;strong&gt;from faith to faith&lt;/strong&gt;.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Galatians Christians also committed this egregious error such that the apostle Paul had to scold them: &lt;em&gt;“Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh? (Galatians 3:3—KJV)”&lt;/em&gt; There are never supposed to be any works in a Christian’s life; works to earn salvation, works to earn God’s favor. Works that are produced through the believers as a byproduct, an outworking of the indwelling Holy Spirit, is never an issue, unless it is paraded before them so much it becomes dead works of the flesh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If faith is the only means through which you can get in God’s kingdom, it alone is the only means for you to live as a child of God. And the works that God has prepared for each individual (Ephesians 2:10) is a different kind of work altogether, as God himself will see to it that they get done, &lt;em&gt;“for it is God who works in you &lt;strong&gt;to will and to act&lt;/strong&gt; in order to fulfill his good purpose (Philippians 2:13—NIV).”&lt;/em&gt; These works are gifts from God as He gives them to us along with His Son. These works are never a measure of our standing before Him, because if they are, who among us can judge what works are good enough?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;only-god-is-good&quot;&gt;Only God is good&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you notice the peculiarity of Jesus’ response to the young man’s question? Don’t you know only God is good? And how can you who are not good produce anything good?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;No good tree bears bad fruit, nor does a bad tree bear good fruit (Luke 6:43).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it’s not only that you cannot through works get to heaven, you don’t even have what it takes to produce good works for that matter. The prophet Isaiah has this assessment of our condition: &lt;em&gt;“All of us have become like one who is unclean, and all our &lt;strong&gt;righteous acts are like filthy rags&lt;/strong&gt;; we all shrivel up like a leaf, and like the wind our sins sweep us away (Isaiah 64:6).”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, someone may argue that we have been saved so we we can do all things through Christ who strengthens us (Philippians 4:13). But is it true, that we can achieve what that was previously impossible? That Jesus’ retort to the young man no longer applies to us? That what He said, &lt;em&gt;“Only God is good,”&lt;/em&gt; no longer holds true? Nothing is further from the truth. God is still the only One who is good, and we’re still sinners saved by grace. We still suffer the consequences of the Fall. We still die, get sick, and sinful thoughts and actions still govern a large part of our lives. The only thing that is certain is our freedom from condemnation and God’s promise of eternal life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To think otherwise is to set ourselves up for constant failures that ultimately will put doubts in our minds that we may not be saved at all, because if we are, why do we still carry our body of death all day long? (Romans 7:24)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What Jesus said, &lt;em&gt;“Only God is good,”&lt;/em&gt; to the one who is fully resolved in his heart that he can no longer be led by the law in his relationship with God, but by His grace and mercies alone, is like a big boulder fallen off his back. A relief from the great burden of having to &lt;em&gt;“Be perfect (Matthew 5:48).”&lt;/em&gt; A permission to be sinners, warts and all, instead of the drudgery of the futile pursuit of trying to be like God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bearing-fruit&quot;&gt;Bearing fruit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The young man in our story attempts to do some good works to earn his place in heaven, but Jesus said good works are produced by Him and through Him after we’re already saved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“I am the vine, you are the branches. He who abides in Me, and I in him, bears much fruit; for without Me you can do nothing (John 15:5).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To think otherwise is to put the cart before the horse. The bearing of fruit is a natural byproduct of our being attached to the vine. You cannot try to induce the fruit bearing, or good works, through force or threatening, no matter how subtle. It’s the outworking of the vine, not the branches. And how do the branches abide in the vine? Through faith, the only instrument God allows Christians to abide in their Redeemer. Their fruit springs forth they know neither when nor how (John 3:8).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;The kingdom of God is like someone who spreads seed on the ground. &lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt;He goes to sleep and gets up, night and day, and the seed sprouts and grows, though &lt;strong&gt;he does not know how&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By itself the soil produces a crop&lt;/strong&gt;, first the stalk, then the head, then the full grain in the head. &lt;sup&gt;29&lt;/sup&gt;And when the grain is ripe, he sends in the sickle because the harvest has come.” (Mark 4:26-29)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An inordinate amount of energy in Christendom is spent on the growing business through all kinds of media. All these efforts end up leading people away from Christ, but toward those they revered as closer to God than themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;only-god-is-good---part-2&quot;&gt;Only God is good - part 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christians ask the same question as the young ruler all the time, in various shape or form, and for whatever reason. Before they knew Christ, they asked so they could enter heaven, now that they’ve known Him, they ask so they could please Him, to be more fit for His kingdom, to be more holy, more sanctified, more perfect. But Jesus’ response to them will still be the same: only God is perfect. Why are you asking this &lt;em&gt;“with words without knowledge (Job 38:2)?”&lt;/em&gt; The only way to access God’s throne is through the &lt;em&gt;“offering of the body of Christ once for all (Hebrews 10:10).”&lt;/em&gt; The asking of such question reveals only one thing: your pride.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Philippians 2:12 says &lt;em&gt;“work out your own salvation with fear and trembling”&lt;/em&gt;, and Christians roll up their sleeves to get busy. And more than just getting busy, they do it with fear and trembling, too. This article will show that traditional interpretations of &lt;em&gt;“work out”&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;“fear and trembling”&lt;/em&gt; are problematic and incongruous with the rest of Scriptures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;work-out-your-own-salvation&quot;&gt;Work out your own salvation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://vacsf.org/assets/images/work-out-your-own-salvation-teaser.jpg&quot; style=&quot;border: 1px solid #cccccc; margin: 7px 15px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 148px; padding: 0px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;
Now that you have received your salvation from Jesus Christ who died on the cross for your sins, it’s time you work it out, make worthwhile the sacrifice of the Son of God. GotQuestions.dot.org describes this “work out” as “… actively pursuing obedience in the process of &lt;u&gt;sanctification&lt;/u&gt; … ‘straining’ and ‘pressing on’ toward the goal of Christlikeness,” while DesiringGod.dot.org has an article with the title “Why &lt;u&gt;MUST&lt;/u&gt; We Work Out Our Salvation?” It explains the reason why: “the works we do &lt;u&gt;prove&lt;/u&gt; that our faith is real. Works are evidence of election.” Different sources give different reasons, but they all point to the need for a Christian to work out their salvation. These interpretations are also consistent with the messages I’ve heard from varying sources over the years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two key concepts in the views expressed above that go against my core belief: sanctification as a process, and works that prove our faith.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I don’t believe sanctification is a process, but it’s a once-for-all gift from God as we place our trust in Christ’s sacrifice. Let’s consider the verse below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified (Hebrews 10:14—KJV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And secondly, I don’t believe our faith must be predicated upon one or more works, because if it is, no one will ever know what work, or works, it is that qualify their faith. Ephesians 2:8-9 are probably the most well known verses that can be used to illustrate this point:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For by grace you are saved through faith, and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God; it is not from works, so that no one can boast (Ephesians 2:8-9—NET).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let’s read Philippians 2:12 in its entirety, and let’s also add verse 13 for clarity:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Wherefore, my beloved, as &lt;strong&gt;ye have always obeyed&lt;/strong&gt;, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure (Philippians 2:12-13—KJV).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As evident from this verse, the problem is not obedience as the Philippian Christians &lt;em&gt;“have always obeyed,”&lt;/em&gt; not just while Paul was with them, but even more so while he was absent. Paul didn’t write that the people SHOULD work out their salvation, or they MUST, or they should MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO, nor did he make any promise of rewards if they do, or gave veiled threats if they don’t, work out their salvation. He questioned the quality of their works, the foundation upon which they work out their salvation. Are they doing things out of envy or selfish ambition? Or are they doing it out of the love for the brethren?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no doubt from the reading of Philippians 2 that the focus is not with the concern whether they work out their salvation, but with how they should do the works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;with-fear-and-trembling&quot;&gt;With fear and trembling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really didn’t have to labor the point as it is rather clear that verse 13 explains the true meaning of  &lt;em&gt;“with fear and trembling.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A New Covenant Christian no longer operates from the realm of the flesh, but from a spirit of grace where he knows everything he does, he deserves no credit, of which he should not boast, for it is God who works in him &lt;em&gt;“both to will and to do of His good pleasure.”&lt;/em&gt; Whenever the flesh is involved, there is self-glorification, and boasting. Ephesians 2:8-9 says since we’re saved by grace, and not by works, we have no reason to boast about ourselves or our abilities. In Romans 3:27, the apostle Paul also discouraged people from boasting as he pointed out to the Romans that they now lived under a new law, one that required faith, not works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, when a New Covenant Christian still uses the law as his guide, he will always look to himself as the prime mover in all his actions. If he does what is expected of him, he gets the blessings, and conversely, if he does not, he stands a chance of losing out on his blessings. This mindset creates an environment where boasting and self promotion thrive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, Paul must have used the phrase &lt;em&gt;“fear and trembling”&lt;/em&gt; as a contrast to the opposite attitude of pride, for the reason being &lt;em&gt;“it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.”&lt;/em&gt;  It is God, not you! So don’t go and strut your stuff, don’t brag about what good things you’ve done for God. Paul does not mean at all that the working out of our salvation involves any sense of duty, obedience, gratitude, reciprocation to what Jesus had done for us, or any other guilt producing motivation at all. He didn’t need to because his audience the Philippians &lt;em&gt;“have always obeyed.”&lt;/em&gt; The danger they faced was not that they were lazy, but in the attitude of their heart involving only one thing: Are they relying on God’s grace, or their own works, in their relationship with God? Do they know that it is God who works in them both &lt;em&gt;“to will and to do”&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is really no need for anyone to serve God in “fear and trembling,” in the atmosphere expected under a ruthless taskmaster. Paul articulated strenuously in several epistles the case for our relating to God through grace only, not works. Paul is also the one who asks us to grow up and stop feeding on the basic teaching of repentance from dead works, or vice versa repentance from NOT doing good works (Hebrews 6:1-2). Therefore, far be it from him to preach “fear and trembling” in the literal sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;working-what-out&quot;&gt;Working WHAT out?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most Christians assume the working out of our salvation involves only things pertaining to faith. Some examples are: going to church, bible study, revival camp, spiritual retreats, evangelistic outreach, preaching the gospel, etc. But did Jesus die to redeem us only for these things? Or he died to restore all the things that make us who we are? Our profession, hope, aspiration, fear, sorrow, pain, joy, weaknesses, strength, personality, ideosyncrasies, and many things that made King David exclaim &lt;em&gt;“I praise you because I’m fearfully and wonderfully made”&lt;/em&gt; (Psalm 139:14).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To work out your salvation is to live the life that God made you in the first place, but with a difference. You used to live in self pity, but now you’re loved by God. You used to indulge in sinful activities to get temporary relief from pain but now, with hearts full of love from God, you’re set free to know the difference. You used to live a life without meaning but now you know you have a special place in the heart of God and his eternal kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t need anyone to tell you that you need to breathe fresh air to live, so it is with the working out of your salvation. It is God who creates this wonderful air for you to breathe, it is also him who works in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure. The caveat is tread lightly, don’t become filled with prideful arrogance, but if there is an attitude you should have, it should be of fear and trembling as you did nothing to deserve even the salvation that you have.&lt;/p&gt;
